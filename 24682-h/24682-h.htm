<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Although</span> the quilt is one of the most familiar
and necessary articles in our households, its story
is yet to be told. In spite of its universal use and
intimate connection with our lives, its past is a
mystery which&mdash;at the most&mdash;can be only partially
unravelled.</p>

<p>The quilt has a tradition of long centuries of
slow but certain progress. Its story is replete with
incidents of love and daring, of sordid pilferings and
generous sacrifices. It has figured in many a thrilling
episode. The same type of handiwork that
has sheltered the simple peasant from wintry blasts
has adorned the great halls of doughty warriors and
noble kings. Humble maids, austere nuns, grand
dames, and stately queens; all have shared in the
fascination of the quilter&rsquo;s art and have contributed
to its advancement. Cottage, convent, and
castle; all have been enriched, at one time or another,
by the splendours of patchwork and the
pleasures of its making.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[Pg&nbsp;xvi]</a></span>
In its suitability for manufacture within the
home, the quilt possesses a peculiar merit. Although
exposed for a full century to the competition
of machinery, under the depressing influence
of which most of the fireside crafts have all but
vanished, the making of quilts as a home industry
has never languished. Its hold on the affections
of womankind has never been stronger than it is
to-day. As a homemaker, the quilt is a most capable
tool lying ready at the hand of every woman.
The selection of design, the care in piecing, the
patience in quilting; all make for feminine contentment
and domestic happiness.</p>

<p>There are more quilts being made at the present
time&mdash;in the great cities as well as in the rural
communities&mdash;than ever before, and their construction
as a household occupation&mdash;and recreation&mdash;is
steadily increasing in popularity. This
should be a source of much satisfaction to all patriotic
Americans who believe that the true source of
our nation&rsquo;s strength lies in keeping the family
hearth flame bright.</p>

<p>As known to-day, the quilt is the result of combining
two kinds of needlework, both of very ancient
origin, but widely different in character.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[Pg&nbsp;xvii]</a></span>
Patchwork&mdash;the art of piecing together fabrics
of various kinds and colours or laying patches of
one kind upon another, is a development of the
primitive desire for adornment. Quilting&mdash;the
method of fastening together layers of cloths in
such a manner as to secure firmly the loose materials
uniformly spread between them, has resulted
from the need of adequate protection against
rigorous climates. The piecing and patching provide
the maker with a suitable field for the display
of artistic ability, while the quilting calls for particular
skill in handling the needle. The fusing of
these two kinds of needlework into a harmonious
combination is a task that requires great patience
and calls for talent of no mean order.</p>

<p>To our grandmothers quilt making meant social
pleasure as well as necessary toil, and to their
grandmothers it gave solace during long vigils in
pioneer cabins. The work of the old-time quilters
possesses artistic merit to a very high degree. While
much of it was designed strictly for utilitarian purposes&mdash;in
fact, more for rugged service than display,
yet the number of beautiful old quilts which
these industrious ancestors have bequeathed to us
is very large. Every now and then there comes
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[Pg&nbsp;xviii]</a></span>
to light one of these old quilts of the most exquisite
loveliness, in which the needlework is almost painful
in its exactness. Such treasures are worthy of
study and imitation, and are deserving of careful
preservation for the inspiration of future generations
of quilters.</p>

<p>To raise in popular esteem these most worthy
products of home industry, to add to the appreciation
of their history and traditions, to give added
interest to the hours of labour which their construction
involves, to present a few of the old masterpieces
to the quilters of to-day; such is the purpose
of this book of quilts.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Patchwork in Antiquity</span></h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE origin of the domestic arts of all nations
is shrouded in mystery. Since accurate
dates cannot be obtained, traditional accounts
must be accepted. The folklore of any
country is always exceedingly interesting and generally
has a few kernels of fact imbedded somewhere
in its flowers of legend, although some of
our most familiar household objects are not even
mentioned by tradition. Spinning and weaving,
however, are very generously treated in the mythology
and folklore of all nations. Nearly every
race has some legend in which claim is made to the
discovery of these twin arts.</p>

<p>In Biblical lore Naa-mah, a sister of Tubal
Cain, belonging to the seventh generation after
Cain, is said to have invented both spinning and
weaving. This tradition is strengthened by the
assertions of some historians that the Phrygians
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg&nbsp;4]</a></span>
were the oldest of races, since their birthplace was
in Armenia, which in turn is credited with having
the Garden of Eden within its boundaries. The
Chinese also can advance very substantial claims
that primeval man was born with eyes aslant. They
at least have a fixed date for the invention of the
loom. This was in 2640 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span> by Lady of Si-Ling,
the wife of a famous emperor, Huang-ti.</p>

<p>The Egyptians who, according to their traditions,
sprung from the soil, and who despised the
Greeks for their late coming into the human arena,
were probably quite as ancient as the Phrygians.
It is known positively that in the wonderful valley
of the Nile there has lived for more than six thousand
years a race remarkable for its inventive
faculties and the developing of the industrial arts.
In the first dawn of human progress, while his
nomadic neighbours roamed carefree about him,
the Egyptian toiled steadily, and left the records
of his achievements beside his God, the Nile.</p>

<p>When investigating any subject, the ability to
see the actual thing itself is more helpful than pages
of description. In Egypt are preserved for us
thousands of wonderful tombs which serve as storehouses
of facts concerning the early civilization of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg&nbsp;5]</a></span>
this land. The mummy wrappings reveal very
distinctly the development of the textiles and decorative
arts. The Egyptians, since the earliest
historical times, were always celebrated for their
manufacture of linen, cotton, and woollen cloths,
and the products of their looms were eagerly sought
by surrounding nations. The fine linen and embroidered
work, yarns and woollen fabrics of both
upper and lower Egypt, were held in the highest
esteem.</p>

<p>Sir J. Gardner Wilkinson, in his history of &ldquo;Ancient
Egypt,&rdquo; tells of their knowledge of dyeing and
of the nature of the fabrics found in the tombs:
&ldquo;The quantity of linen manufactured and used in
Egypt was very great; and, independent of that
made up into articles of dress, the numerous wrappers
required for enveloping the mummies, both of
men and animals, show how large a supply must
have been kept ready for the constant demand at
home as well as for that of the foreign market.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The actual experiments made, with the aid of
powerful microscopes ... on the nature of the
fibres of linen and cotton threads, have shown that
the former invariably present a cylindrical form,
transparent, and articulated, or joined like a cane,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg&nbsp;6]</a></span>
while the latter offer the appearance of a flat riband,
with a hem or border at each edge; so that
there is no possibility of mistaking the fibres of
either, except, perhaps, when the cotton is in an
unripe state, and the flattened shape of the centre
is less apparent. The results having been found
similar in every instance, and the structure of the
fibres thus unquestionably determined, the threads
of mummy cloths were submitted to the same test,
and no exception was found to their being linen,
nor were they even a mixture of linen and cotton.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Another very remarkable discovery of the
Egyptians was the use of mordants. They were
acquainted with the effect of acids on colour, and
submitted the cloth they dyed to one of the same
processes adopted in our modern manufactories;
and while, from his account, we perceive how little
Pliny understood the process he was describing,
he at the same time gives us the strongest evidence
of its truth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In Egypt,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;they stain cloths in a
wonderful manner. They take them in their original
state, quite white, and imbue them, not with
a dye, but with certain drugs which have the power
of absorbing and taking colour. When this is
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg&nbsp;7]</a></span>
done, there is still no appearance of change in the
cloths; but so soon as they are dipped into a bath
of the pigment, which has been prepared for the
purpose, they are taken out properly coloured.
The singular thing is, that though the bath contains
only one colour, several hues are imparted to
the piece, these changes depending on the natures
of the drug employed; nor can the colour be afterward
washed off; and surely if the bath had many
colours in it, they must have presented a confused
appearance on the cloth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The ability of the Egyptians to have a variety
of colours for use in their embroideries and patchworks
contributed much to the beauty of these
arts.</p>

<p>Embroidery in various forms, applied to all sorts
of objects, was commonly practised throughout
ancient Egypt, and the Israelites, at the time of the
Exodus, carried their knowledge of the textile arts
with them to India. Ezekiel in chapter twenty-seven,
verse seven, in telling of the glories of Tyre,
says: &ldquo;Of fine linen with broidered work Egypt
was thy sail, that it might be to thee for an ensign.&rdquo;
In &ldquo;De Bello Judaico,&rdquo; by Flavius Josephus,
another reference is made to ancient needlework:</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg&nbsp;8]</a></span>
&ldquo;When Herod the Great rebuilt the temple of
Jerusalem nineteen years before our era, he was
careful not to omit in the decoration of the sanctuary
the marvels of textile art which had been the
chief embellishment of the tabernacle during the
long wanderings in the desert. Before the doors
of the most sacred place he hung a Babylonian
tapestry fifty cubits high by sixteen wide: azure
and flax, scarlet and purple were blended in it with
admirable art and rare ingenuity, for these represented
the various elements. Scarlet signified
fire; linen, the earth; azure, the air; and purple, the
sea. These meanings were derived in two instances
from similarity of colour: in the other two
from their origin, the earth yielding linen and the
sea purple. The whole range of the heavens, except
the signs, was wrought upon this veil or hanging.
The porticos were also enriched with many coloured
tapestries ornamented with purple flowers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There is very meagre information concerning the
character and style of tapestry in Egypt during the
rule of the Pharaohs. MM. Perrot and Chipiex,
in their &ldquo;Histoire de l&rsquo;Art dans l&rsquo;Antiquit&eacute;,&rdquo; publish
a painting containing a hanging of purely ornamental
design formed of circles, triangles, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg&nbsp;9]</a></span>
palm leaves reversed. Wilkinson describes an
Egyptian hanging&mdash;an original, not a reproduction&mdash;found
in an English collection: &ldquo;In the
centre, on a green ground, stands a boy in white,
with a goose beside him; and around this centre a
border of red and blue lines; then white figures on
a yellow ground; again blue lines and red ornaments;
and lastly red, white, and blue embroideries.&rdquo;
This is a very ancient example of true
applied work combined with embroidery. In the
Psalms it is said that Pharaoh&rsquo;s daughter shall be
brought to the king in a raiment of needlework
and that &ldquo;her clothing is of wrought gold.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The huge columns, bas-reliefs, and the various
architectural details of the early Egyptian buildings
were all decorated in vivid colours. The interiors
of their temples were also covered with
gayly coloured scenes which have preserved for
us a most extensive knowledge of their life and customs.
Their mummy cases were painted in the
most brilliant hues, and often the wrappings of the
mummies themselves bore brightly coloured portraits
of the deceased. Since the Egyptians lived
in an atmosphere of brilliant colour, with ever-shining
sun, the bluest of skies, and the purple
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg&nbsp;10]</a></span>
glow of the desert always before them, it is
not surprising that they used their brushes with
lavish hand. Every plane surface called for ornamentation,
whether on temple or shroud. Their
pigments, both mineral and vegetable, were remarkable
for their permanence.</p>

<p>The crude and childish way in which the Egyptians
applied their paint in distinct patches would
lead one to believe that patchwork was included
in their earliest needlework, even if no actual proof
existed. But all nations have at some period used
the needle to copy the masterpieces of great artists.
The English, as a typical example of this spirit of
imitation, sought on a background of cloth of gold
to embroider the saints from the canvas of Fra
Angelico. Also the French, in the manufacture
of their tapestries, copied the works of many of the
old masters. Positive proof of the existence of
patchwork, or as some choose to call it, &ldquo;applied
work,&rdquo; in Egypt at a very early period is found on a
robe belonging to an early sovereign. This article
of apparel was of linen and, in general design, resembled
a modern apron. According to Wilkinson,
it was &ldquo;richly ornamented in front with lions&rsquo;
heads and other devices, probably of coloured
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg&nbsp;11]</a></span>
leather; and the border was formed of a row of asps,
the emblem of royalty. Sometimes the royal name
with an asp on each side was embroidered upon it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The most ancient example of patchwork is a
coloured gazelle hide presented in the Museum of
Cairo. The colours of the different pieces of skin
are bright pink, deep golden yellow, pale primrose,
bluish green, and pale blue. This patchwork served
as the canopy or pall of an Egyptian queen about
the year 960 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.&nbsp;C.</span> She was the mother-in-law of
Shishak, who besieged and captured Jerusalem
shortly after the death of Solomon. On its upper
border this interesting specimen has repeated
scarabs, cartouches with inscriptions, discs, and
serpents. The lower border has a central device
of radiating lotus flowers; this is flanked by two
narrow panels with cartouches; beyond these are
two gazelles facing toward the lotus device. Next
to the gazelles on each side is a curious detail consisting
of two oddly shaped ducks, back to back;
then come the two outer compartments of the border,
each of which enclose a winged beetle, or scarab&aelig;us,
bearing a disc or emblem of the sun. The
other main division of the field is spotted in regular
order with open blossom forms. There is decided
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg&nbsp;12]</a></span>
order in the repetition and arrangement of these
details, which gives a rather stiff and formal look
to the whole design.</p>

<p>To-day Egyptians are making patchwork that is
undoubtedly a development of the very art practised
in the days of Ptolemy, Rameses, and Cleopatra.
They do not use their patchwork to adorn
quilts, since these are unknown in the warm Nile
valley, but as covers for cushions, panels for screens,
and decorations suitable for wall hangings. Generally
but two kinds of material are employed in its
construction: a rather loosely woven cotton cloth,
and a firm, coarse linen. The cottons used are all
gayly dyed in plain colours, and the linens are in
the natural shades, with perhaps a slight mixture
of white. The patchwork designs are typically
Egyptian, many pieces being covered with replicas
of paintings found on tombs and temples. These
paintings are copied as faithfully in colour as in
design, even the hieroglyphics being exactly reproduced,
and altogether make very striking and
effective decorations.</p>

<p>The modern Egyptians have the innate taste and
ability of all Orientals for harmonizing colour.
Their universal use of black to outline and define
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg&nbsp;13]</a></span>
most of the designs produces a beautiful harmony
between otherwise clashing hues. With nearly as
many shades at their disposal in cloth as a painter
has in paint, they are quite ambitious in their attempts
to produce realistic scenes. On some of the
best specimens of modern Egyptian patchwork
gods and goddesses are shown sitting enthroned
surrounded by attendants and slaves bearing
trophies of war and chase as offerings to the divine
beings. On others, groups of men and women are
shown, humbly presenting salvers of fruit and the
sacred flower&mdash;the lotus&mdash;to their gods. Some of
the most effective work is decorated with a simple
life-size figure of Osiris or Rameses the Great in
brilliant colours. A few of the more subdued patchwork
designs consist of a solitary scarab, the sacred
beetle of the Pharaohs, or an asp or two gracefully
entwined. The smaller pieces make practical and
admirable cushion covers. There are many attractive
shops in Cairo that sell quantities of this gay
patchwork, and few tourists leave Egypt without a
specimen or two as mementoes of the paintings
that give us a glimpse of Egypt&rsquo;s ancient splendour.</p>

<p>While among the ancient Greeks and Romans
all the arts of the needle were held in the greatest
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg&nbsp;14]</a></span>
esteem, comparatively little attention was paid to
the adornment of their sleeping apartments. Accounts
of early Greek houses state that, while the
bedchambers were hung all about with curtains
and draperies, these were usually of plain fabrics
with little attempt at decoration. Of patchwork
or appliqu&eacute;, as known to the Egyptians and Hebrews,
the Greeks and Romans have left us no
trace. However, as substantiating the regard
shown for needlework by the Greeks and Romans,
the following two pleasing myths have come down
to us: one, the &ldquo;Story of Arachne,&rdquo; as related by
Ovid; the other from the &ldquo;Odyssey&rdquo; of Homer.</p>

<p>Arachne, a most industrious needleworker, had
the audacity to contest against Pallas, the goddess
of the art of weaving. With her bobbins, Arachne
wove such wonderful pictures of the Loves of the
Gods that Pallas, conscious of having been surpassed
by a mortal, in an outburst of anger struck
her. Arachne, humiliated by the blow, and unable
to avenge it, hanged herself in despair. Whereupon
the goddess relented, and with the intention
of gratifying Arachne&rsquo;s passionate love of weaving,
transformed her into a spider and bade her weave
on forever.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg&nbsp;15]</a></span>
The other interesting incident of ancient times is
that of Penelope&rsquo;s patient weaving. It is related
that, after one short year of wedded happiness, her
husband Ulysses was called to take part in the
Trojan War. Not a single message having been
received from him by Penelope during his long absence,
a doubt finally arose as to his being still
alive. Numerous suitors then sought her hand,
but Penelope begged for time and sought to put
them off with many excuses. One of her devices
for delay was that of being very busy preparing
a funeral robe for Ulysses&rsquo; father. She announced
that she would be unable to choose another husband
until after this robe was finished. Day after
day she industriously wove, spending patient hours
at her loom, but each night secretly ravelled out
the product of her day&rsquo;s labour. By this stratagem
Penelope restrained the crowd of ardent suitors
up to the very day of Ulysses&rsquo; return.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Patchwork and Quilting During the Middle
Ages</span></h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>N THE early days of Christianity the various
organizations of the mother church took a
deep interest in all the textile arts, and we are
indebted to the ecclesiastical orders for what progress
was made in needlework during the beginning
of the Middle Ages. The makers of church hangings
and vestments were stimulated by thoughts
of the spiritual blessings with which they were assured
their work would be rewarded. Much of
this early ecclesiastic needlework is extremely
elaborate and was always eagerly desired by the
holy orders. At one time the craze for gorgeous
vestments reached such an extreme that we have
record of one worthy bishop chiding his priests because
they &ldquo;carried their religion on their backs instead
of in their hearts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The artistic needlework of the Christian era
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg&nbsp;17]</a></span>
consists almost entirely of embroidery; no positive
reference to patchwork or quilting being found in
western Europe prior to the time of the Crusades.
But with this great movement, thousands of the
most intelligent men in Europe, urged by religious
enthusiasm combined with love of adventure, forced
their way into eastern countries whose culture and
refinements of living far surpassed their own. The
luxuries which they found in Syria were eagerly
seized and carried home to all the western lands.
Returning Crusaders exhibited fine stuffs of every
description that roused the envy of all who obtained
a glimpse of them. A vigorous commerce with
the east was immediately stimulated. From
Syria merchants brought into Italy, Spain, and
France silks and cottons to supplement the native
linen and wool, and also many kinds of embroidered
work of a quality much finer than ever known
before. As a result dyeing, weaving, and needlework
entered on an era of great development.</p>

<p>Previous to the eleventh century so memorable
in the history of the Crusaders, references to quilting
and patchwork are few and uncertain, but from
that time on these twin arts became more and more
conspicuous in the needlecraft of nearly every
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg&nbsp;18]</a></span>
country in western Europe. This is explained by
the stimulus which was given to these arts by the
specimens of appliqu&eacute; hangings and garments
brought from Syria, where the natives wrought for
centuries the identical applied work carried into
Palestine from Egypt in Biblical times by the
Hebrews and the Ph&oelig;nicians.</p>

<p>About the earliest applied work of which we have
record were the armorial bearings of the Crusaders.
A little later came rather elaborate designs applied
to their cloaks and banners. Among other specimens
of Old English needlework is a piece of applied
work at Stonyhurst College depicting a knight on
horseback. That this knight represents a Crusader
is beyond question since the cross, the insignia
of the cause, is a prominent figure in the
ornamentation of the knight&rsquo;s helmet and shield,
and is also prominent on the blanket on the horse.</p>

<p>Noticeable progress in the arts of both quilting
and appliqu&eacute; was made during the Middle Ages in
Spain. Spanish women have always been noted
for their cleverness with the needle, and quite a
few of the stitches now in use are credited to them.
At the time of King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella,
applied work had long been known. Whether
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg&nbsp;19]</a></span>
it developed from imitating garments brought home
by the returning Crusaders, or was adopted from
the Moors, who gave the best of their arts to Spain
during the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries,
cannot be positively stated. However, it is worthy
of notice that whenever the Christian came in
contact with the Moor, a great advance in the
textile arts of the former could generally be observed.
This holds true even down to this day,
our eagerness to possess the rugs of Turkey and
Afghanistan, and the imitation of these designs in
the manufacture of domestic carpets, being a case
in point.</p>

<p>During the reign of King Philip II, 1527-1598,
the grandees of the Spanish court wore beautifully
wrought garments, rich with applied work and
embroidery. A sixteenth-century hanging of silk
and velvet appliqu&eacute;, now preserved in Madrid, is
typical of the best Spanish work. It is described
as having a gray-green silk foundation, on which
are applied small white silk designs outlined with
yellow cord; alternating with the green silk are
bands of dark red velvet with ornamented designs
cut from the green silk, and upon which are small
pieces of white silk representing berries. Also,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg&nbsp;20]</a></span>
another handsome specimen of Spanish applied
work of the seventeenth century is a linen curtain
richly embellished with heraldic emblems couched
with gold thread. Horse trappings and reposters,
loaded with appliqu&eacute; flowers cut from gold and
silver cloth, were much in evidence among the
Spanish nobility of this period.</p>

<p>Of particular interest, as showing how oriental
quilting designs filtered into Europe through the
intercourse of the early Portuguese traders and
missionaries with the East Indies, is the brief
mention by Margaret S. Burton of a very elaborate
old quilt now in a New York collection: &ldquo;My next
find was a tremendous bed quilt which is used as
a porti&egrave;re for double folding doors. It formed
part of a collection of hangings owned by the
late Stanford White. He claimed there were only
four of its kind in existence, and this the only one
in America. It is valued at $1,000. It is a Portuguese
bed quilt and was embroidered centuries
ago by the Portuguese missionary monks sent to
India. They were commissioned by their queen
to embroider them for her to present as wedding
gifts to her favourite ladies-in-waiting.&rdquo; On account
of intricacy and originality of design this
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg&nbsp;21]</a></span>
quilt represents years of patient work. It is
hand embroidered in golden coloured floss upon a
loosely woven linen which had been previously
quilted very closely. The work is in chain stitch,
and there are at least fifty different stitch patterns.
In the centre panel is the sacred cat of India.
Doves bearing olive branches, pomegranates, daisies,
and passion flowers are intermingled in the
beautiful design.</p>

<p>While the uses of patchwork were known over
Europe long before the Renaissance, some credit
its introduction, into Italy at least, to the Florentine
painter, Botticelli (1446-1510). The applied
work, or &ldquo;thought work,&rdquo; of the Armenians so
appealed to him that he used it on hangings for
church decoration. Under his influence the use
of the applied work, <i>opus conservetum</i>, for chapel
curtains and draperies was greatly extended. In
time these simple patchwork hangings were supplanted
by the mural paintings and tapestries
now so famous. There are still in existence some
rare pieces of Italian needlework of the sixteenth
century having designs of fine lace interspersed
among the embroidered appliqu&eacute; of silk.</p>

<p>A homely cousin of the gorgeous <i>opus
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg&nbsp;22]</a></span>
conservetum</i>, which has filled its useful though
humble office down to the present day, is the heavy
quilted and padded leather curtain used in many
Italian churches in lieu of a door. Many of the
church doors are too massive and cumbersome to
be opened readily by the entering worshippers, so
they are left constantly open. Leather hangings
often several inches thick and quilted with rows of
horizontal stitches rather widely spaced, are hung
before the open doorways. Even these curtains
are often quite stiff and unyielding, so that holding
back corners for the passage of both worshipper
and tourist forms a favourite occupation for
numerous beggars.</p>

<p>Appliqu&eacute;, described as <i>opus consutum</i>, or cut
work, was made in Florence and Venice, chiefly
for ecclesiastical purposes, during the height of
their glory in the fifteenth century. One such piece
of Florentine cut work is remarkable for its great
beauty and the skill shown in bringing together both
weaving and embroidery. &ldquo;Much of the architectural
accessories is loom wrought, while the
extremities of the evangelists are all done by the
needle; but the head, neck, and long beard are
worked by themselves upon very fine linen, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg&nbsp;23]</a></span>
afterward put together in such a way that the full
white beard overlaps the tunics.... For the
sake of expedition, all the figures were sometimes
at once shaped out of woven silk, satin, velvet,
linen, or woollen cloth, and sewed upon the grounding
of the article.... Sometimes the cut
work done in this way is framed, as it were, with
an edging either in plain or gilt leather, hempen or
silken cord, like the leadings of a stained-glass
window.&rdquo; Gold and silver starlike flowers, sewn
on appliqu&eacute; embroideries, were common to Venice
and also southern Germany in the fifteenth century.</p>

<p>Belonging to the Italian Renaissance period are
some marvellous panels, once part of a curtain,
which are now preserved in the South Kensington
Museum in London. The foundation of these
panels is of beautiful blue damask having applied
designs cut from yellow satin. These hangings
are described as being very rich in effect and unusually
handsome, and nothing in the annals of
needlework of their period was more glorious.</p>

<p>A very ingenious patchwork, originating in
Italy during the sixteenth century and peculiar
to that country and Spain, consisted of patterns
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg&nbsp;24]</a></span>
designed so as to be counter hanging. For example,
if one section of a length of such patchwork
consisted of a blue satin pattern on a yellow velvet
ground, the adjoining section would, through the
interchange of materials, consist of a yellow velvet
pattern on a blue satin ground. The joints of the
patching were overlaid with cord or gimp, stitched
down so as to conceal them entirely and give definition
to the forms constituting the pattern.</p>

<p>Italian needleworkers were very fond of this
&ldquo;transposed appliqu&eacute; upon two fabrics,&rdquo; especially
when composed of designs of foliage conventionally
treated, or of arabesques and scrolls. On a
piece of old Milanese damask, figured with violet
on violet, appear designs in appliqu&eacute; cut from two
shades of yellow satin. These are remarkable
for their powerful relief, suggesting sculpture rather
than embroidery, and have been pronounced
worthy of the best masters of their time&mdash;namely,
that period so rich in suggestions of ornament&mdash;the
seventeenth century.</p>

<p>Closely related to patchwork, but not as commonly
used, is &ldquo;inlay.&rdquo; In the making of this style
of decoration one material is not laid on to another,
but into it. It is the fitting together of small
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg&nbsp;25]</a></span>
sections of any desired fabric in a prearranged
design. For convenience, all the pieces are placed
upon a foundation of sufficient firmness, but which
does not appear when the work is finished. Ornamental
stitches conceal the seams where the edges
meet, and it is especially adapted for making
heraldic devices. During the Renaissance it was
much used by both Spaniards and Italians, who
learned the art from the Moors.</p>

<p>An example of quilting, attributed to the Island
of Sicily about the year 1400, is described as being
a ground of buff-coloured linen. The raised effect
is obtained by an interpadding of wool, and the
designs are outlined in brown thread. This entire
coverlet is embroidered with scenes from the life
of Tristan, who frequently engaged in battle
against King Langair, the oppressor of his country.
This bit of quilting hangs in the Victoria and
Albert Museum in London. Another hanging of
the fourteenth century, belonging to the same collection,
shows a spirited naval battle between
galleys. A striking peculiarity of this hanging is
that floral designs are scattered in great profusion
among the boats of the combatants.</p>

<p>A patchwork made by the application of bits of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg&nbsp;26]</a></span>
leather to velvet was extensively used in some
European countries during the Middle Ages. As
leather did not fray and needed no sewing over
at the edge, but only sewing down, stitching well
within the edge gave the effect of a double outline.
This combination of leather and velvet was introduced
from Morocco. A wonderful tent of this
leather patchwork, belonging to the French king,
Fran&ccedil;ois I, was taken by the Spanish at the battle
of Pavia (1525), and is still preserved in the armoury
at Madrid.</p>

<p>Some of the very finest specimens of the quilting
of the Middle Ages have been preserved for us in
Persia. Here the art, borrowed at a very early
period from the Arabs, was developed in an unusual
and typically oriental manner. Prayer
rugs, carpets, and draperies of linen, silk, and satin
were among the products of the Persian quilters.</p>

<p>We are indebted to Mr. Alan S. Cole for the
following description of a seventeenth-century
Persian quilted bath carpet, now preserved at the
South Kensington Museum in London. &ldquo;This
typical Persian embroidery is a linen prayer or
bath carpet, the bordering or outer design of which
partly takes the shape of the favourite Persian
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg&nbsp;27]</a></span>
architectural niche filled in with such delicate
scrolling stem ornament as is so lavishly used in
that monument of sixteenth-century Mohammedan
art, the Taj Mahal at Agra. In the centre of the
carpet beneath the niche form is a thickly blossoming
shrub, laid out on a strictly geometric or
formal plan, but nevertheless depicted with a fairly
close approach to the actual appearance of bunches
of blossoms and of leaves in nature. But the
regular and corresponding curves of the stems, and
the ordered recurrence of the blossom bunches,
give greater importance to ornamental character
than to any intention of giving a picture of a tree.
Similar stems, blossoms, and leaves are still more
formally and ornamentally adapted in the border
of the carpet, and to fill in the space between the
border and the niche shape. The embroidery is of
chain stitch with white, yellow, green, and red
silks. But before this embroidery was taken in
hand the whole of the linen was minutely stitched.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Worthy of mention is a patchwork panel made
in Resht, Persia, in the eighteenth century: &ldquo;The
foundation ground is of ivory coloured cloth, and
applied to it, almost entirely covering the ivory
background, are designs cut from crimson, cinnamon,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg&nbsp;28]</a></span>
pink, black, turquoise, and sapphire coloured
cloths, all richly embroidered in marigold and
green silk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The following is a quilt anecdote, typically
oriental, which contains a bit of true philosophy.
It seems that the hero, Nass-ed-Din Hodja, was
a Turkish person who became chief jester to the
terrible Tamerlane during his invasion of Asia
Minor. He was also the hero, real or imaginary,
of many other stories which originated during the
close of the fourteenth and the beginning of the
fifteenth centuries. His tomb is still shown at
Akshekir. The story is given entire as it appeared
in &ldquo;Turkey of the Ottoman&rdquo; by L.&nbsp;M. Garnett:</p>


<h4>HOW THE HODJA LOST HIS QUILT</h4>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;One winter&rsquo;s night, when the Hodja and his
wife were snugly asleep, two men began to quarrel
and fight under the window. Both drew knives
and the dispute threatened to become serious.
Hearing the noise, the Hodja&rsquo;s wife got up, looked
out of the window and, seeing the state of affairs,
woke her husband, saying: &lsquo;Great heavens, get up
and separate them or they will kill each other.&rsquo;
But the Hodja only answered sleepily: &lsquo;Wife,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg&nbsp;29]</a></span>
dear, come to bed again; on my faith there are no
men in the world; I wish to be quiet; it is a winter&rsquo;s
night. I am an old man, and perhaps if I
went out they might beat me.&rsquo; The Hodja&rsquo;s
wife was a wise woman. She kissed his hands and
his feet. The Hodja was cross and scolded her,
but he threw the quilt about him, went downstairs
and out to where the disputants were, and said
to them: &lsquo;For the sake of my white beard cease,
my sons, your strife.&rsquo; The men, in reply, pulled
the quilt from the Hodja&rsquo;s shoulders and made
off with it. &lsquo;Very well,&rsquo; observed the old man.
He re&euml;ntered, locked the door, and went upstairs.
Said his wife: &lsquo;You did very well to go out to
those men. Have they left off quarrelling?&rsquo; &lsquo;They
have,&rsquo; replied the Hodja. &lsquo;What were they quarrelling
about, Hodja?&rsquo; &lsquo;Fool,&rsquo; replied the Hodja,
&lsquo;they were quarrelling for my quilt. Henceforward
my motto shall be, &ldquo;Beware of serpents.&rdquo;&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Appliqu&eacute;, or applied work, has never been used
in France to the same extent as in England, even
though the French name &ldquo;appliqu&eacute;&rdquo; is more
frequently used than any other. However, there
is one striking example of appliqu&eacute; work, of Rhenish
or French origin, now hanging in the Victoria
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg&nbsp;30]</a></span>
and Albert Museum in London. This realistic
patchwork represents a fight between an armoured
knight mounted on a high-stepping white horse and
a ferocious dragon. The designs are arranged in a
fashion similar to the blocks in a modern quilt, and
depict several scenes showing the progress of the
combat. There is also a border covered closely
with figures of monks, knights, and ladies.</p>

<p>An extract from &ldquo;First Steps in Collecting,&rdquo; by
Grace M. Vallois, gives an interesting glimpse of
an old French attic. An object of great interest
to us is the old, unfinished quilt she discovered
there: &ldquo;A rummaging expedition in a French
<i>grenier</i> yields more treasures than one taken in an
English lumber room. The French are more
conservative; they dislike change and never throw
away anything. Among valuable antiques found
in the <i>grenier</i> of a Louis XV house in the Pyrenees
were some rare curtains of white linen ornamented
with designs cut from beautiful old chintz; the
edges of the applied designs were covered with
tightly twisted cotton cord. Also, in the same
room, in a drawer of an old chestnut-wood bureau,
was found an unfinished bed quilt very curiously
worked. It was of linen with a filling of rather
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg&nbsp;31]</a></span>
soft cotton cord about an eighth of an inch wide.
These cords were held in place by rows of minute
stitching of white silk, making the bedcover almost
solid needlework. Besides the quilting there were
at rather wide intervals conventional flowers in
peacock shades of blue and green silk executed in
chain stitch. When found, the needle was still
sticking in one of the flowers, and many were
traced ready for work. The traced lines appear to
have been made with India ink and were very
clear and delicate. What caused the abrupt interruption
of the old quilt no one can tell. It is possible
that the great terror of 1793 caused the patient
maker to flee from her unfinished task.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the countries of northern Europe there is
scarcely any record concerning the art of quilting
and patchwork, and little can be said beyond the
fact that both existed in some form or other. In
Germany the quilt so familiar to us is practically
unknown. In the past appliqu&eacute; was very little
used, except as cut work, or <i>opus consutum</i>, in
blazonments and heraldic devices. The thick
feather beds of medieval Germany were covered
with various kinds of thick comforts filled with
either wool or feathers, and sometimes sparsely
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg&nbsp;32]</a></span>
quilted. The only decoration of the comfort consisted
of a band of ornamental work, ten to twenty
inches wide, usually worked in cross-stitch design
with brightly coloured yarns. These bands were
generally loose upon the comfort, one edge being
held down by the pillow, but occasionally they
were sewed to the edge of the bedcover.</p>

<p>In a work on arts and crafts relating to their
presence in Sweden, it is written that &ldquo;woven
hangings were used to decorate the timbered walls
of the halls of the vikings. They were hung over
the temples, and they decorated the timber sepulchres
of the dead. When the timbered grave of the
Danish queen, Fyra Danabode, who died about
950, was opened, remains of woven woollen cloth
were found.&rdquo; As far back as Swedish records
go it can be shown that Swedish women wove and
sewed figured material.</p>

<p>On account of the cold there is urgent need
of wall hangings, and they are used extensively
throughout Scandinavia. On festive occasions
the stiff, cold appearance of Swedish peasants&rsquo;
homes is transformed by the gay wall coverings
to one of hospitality and warmth. The hangings
used are made of linen, either painted or embroidered
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg&nbsp;33]</a></span>
in bright colours. The painted ones are especially
interesting as they depict many historical
scenes. Allegorical and religious subjects are also
used to decorate many of these linen hangings.
The Swedes are very patriotic, and on their wall
hangings show all the saints clad in typical Swedish
costumes. The apostles wear Swedish jack boots,
loose collars, and pea jackets; and Joseph, as governor
of Egypt, is shown wearing a three-cornered
hat and smoking a pipe.</p>

<p>There is a valuable collection of Swedish needlework
in the Northern Museum of Stockholm, dating
from 1639 to the nineteenth century. Among
this collection there are a few small pieces of applied
work: some cushions, glove gauntlets, and a woman&rsquo;s
handbag. It is possible that patchwork
was used more extensively than the museum&rsquo;s display
would indicate, but since large pieces are
very rarely found, patchwork was evidently not
held in the same esteem as embroidery and painting.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Patchwork and Quilting in Old England</span></h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>N SEARCHING for the beginning of needlework
in England, the first authentic date revealed relating
directly to this subject is 709, when the
Bishop of Sherborne writes of the skill Englishwomen
had attained at that time in the use of the needle.
Preserved in various museums are some examples of
Anglo-Saxon embroidery of uncertain date, that are
known to have been made before the Bishop of Sherborne&rsquo;s
time. Mention should also be made of the
wonderful Bayeux Tapestry. This ancient piece is
227 feet long and twenty inches wide, and is of great
historical interest, in that it illustrates events of English
history from the accession of Edward the Confessor
to the English defeat at Hastings by the
Normans in 1066. There is some doubt as to whether
this tapestry, which has the characteristic of typical
appliqu&eacute;&mdash;namely, the absence of shading&mdash;is actually
of English workmanship, but it is unquestionably
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg&nbsp;35]</a></span>
of Anglo-Saxon origin. It was first hung in
Bayeux Cathedral in 1476.</p>

<p>It is a generally accepted fact that appliqu&eacute; and
embroidery are closely related and of about equal
age, although relatively few examples of the former
are preserved in collections of needlework. One
of the oldest authentic bits of appliqu&eacute; is at Stonyhurst
College. It represents a knight clad in full
armour, mounted on a spirited galloping horse.
The horse is covered with an elaborately wrought
blanket and has an imposing ornament on his
head. The knight wears a headdress of design
similar to that of the horse and, with arm uplifted
and sword drawn, appears about to attack
a foe. This work is well done, and the pose of
both man and horse shows spirit. It is said to have
been made during the thirteenth century. Preserved
to us from this same period is the tattered
fragment of a coat worn by Edward, the Black
Prince, and which now hangs over his tomb in
Canterbury Cathedral. With it are the helmet
and gauntlets he wore and the shield he carried.
The coat is of a red and blue velvet, now sadly
faded, applied to a calico background and closely
quilted. It is too elaborate to have been made to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg&nbsp;36]</a></span>
wear under his armour, and was probably worn during
state functions where armour was not required,
although it was then customary to wear thickly
padded and quilted coats and hoods in order to
ease the weight of the heavy and unyielding coats
of mail.</p>

<p>Much of the best needlework in England at this
early period was for the church. Neither labour
nor expense was spared to make the magnificent
decorations used in the old cathedrals. Aside
from the linens, silks, and velvets used in this construction,
much gold and silver bullion was wrought
into the elaborate altar hangings, altar fronts, and
ecclesiastical vestments. In their ornamentation
applied work was freely used, especially on the
large hangings draped over the altar.</p>

<p>It was during the earliest period that the Latin
name <i>opus consutum</i> was commonly used to designate
patchwork. Chain stitch also was much used
on early English embroidery; to such an extent
that it is now of great service as an identification
mark to fix the dates of medieval needlework.
Chain stitch was dignified by the Latin name <i>opus
anglicanum</i>. Only the most elaborate and richest
of embroideries have been preserved; the reason
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg&nbsp;37]</a></span>
being that much of the work was done with silver
and gold threads which were in reality fine wires
of these precious metals. Being exceedingly costly,
they were given unusual care, many being kept
with the royal plate and jewels. One specimen
made in 905 by Aelfled, the queen of Edward,
the Elder, is now treasured in Durham Cathedral.
It is described as being &ldquo;of almost solid gold thread,
so exquisitely embroidered that it resembles a fine
illuminated manuscript,&rdquo; and is indescribably beautiful.
In many instances the fabrics of these old
embroideries have partly fallen away, leaving
only frail fragments of the original material held
together by the lasting threads of gold and
silver.</p>

<p>The great amount of precious metals used in
making the richest garments and hangings sometimes
made them objects to be desired by avaricious
invaders. In an inventory of the contents
of Cardinal Wolsey&rsquo;s great palace at Hampton
Court there are mentioned, among many other
rare specimens of needlework of that period, &ldquo;230
bed hangings of English embroidery.&rdquo; None of
them is now in existence, and it is supposed that
they were torn apart in order to fill the coffers of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg&nbsp;38]</a></span>
some vandal who preferred the metal in them to
their beauty as hangings.</p>

<p>Among the sumptuous furnishings belonging to
the Tudor period, applied work held a prominent
place. Vast spaces of cold palace walls were
covered by great wall hangings, archways were
screened, and every bed was enclosed with curtains
made of stoutly woven material, usually more
or less ornamented. This was before the advent
of French tapestry, which later supplanted the English
appliqu&eacute; wall draperies. The Tudor period
was also the time when great rivalry in dress existed.
&ldquo;The esquire endeavoured to outshine the
knight, the knight the baron, the baron the
earl, the earl the king himself, in the richness of
his apparel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In direct contrast to the long inventories of
beautiful and valuable clothing, bedcovers, and
hangings of the rich, are the meagre details relating
to the life and household effects of the landless
English peasant. In all probability he copied as
far as he was able some of the utilities and comforts
used by his superiors. If he possessed a cover for
his bed, it was doubtless made of the cheapest
woven material obtainable. No doubt the pieced
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg&nbsp;39]</a></span>
or patched quilt contributed materially to his comfort.
In &ldquo;Arts and Crafts in the Middle Ages,&rdquo;
Julia de Wolf Addison describes a child&rsquo;s bed
quilt included in an inventory of furniture at the
Priory in Durham in 1446, &ldquo;which was embroidered
in the four corners with the Evangelistic symbols.&rdquo;
In the &ldquo;Squier of Lowe Degree,&rdquo; a fifteenth-century
romance, there is allusion to a bed of which
the head sheet is described as embroidered &ldquo;with
diamonds and rubies bright.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was during the gorgeous reign of Henry VIII
that the finest specimens of combined embroidery
and patchwork, now preserved in various museums,
were made. It was really patch upon patch, for
before the motives were applied to the foundation
they were elaborately embroidered in intricate
designs; and after being applied, they had their
edges couched with gold and silver cord and ornate
embroidery stitches. Mrs. Lowes relates in &ldquo;Old
Lace and Needlework&rdquo; that, during the time of
Henry VIII, embroidery, as distinct from garment
making, appeared; and every article of wearing
apparel became an object worthy of decoration.
&ldquo;Much fine stitching was put into the fine white
undergarments of that time, and the overdresses
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg&nbsp;40]</a></span>
of both men and women became stiff with gold
thread and jewels. Much use was made of slashing
and quilting, the point of junction being dotted
with pearls and precious stones. Noble ladies
wore dresses heavily and richly embroidered with
gold, and the train was so weighty that train
bearers were pressed into service. In the old
paintings the horses belonging to kings and nobles
wear trappings of heavily embroidered gold. Even
the hounds, which are frequently represented with
their masters, have collars massively decorated with
gold bullion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mary, Queen of Scots, was devoted to the needle
and was expert in its use. It is said that while in
France she learned lace making and embroidery.
Many wall hangings, bed draperies, bedcovers,
and house linens are the work of her skilful fingers,
or were made under her personal direction.
A number of examples of her work are now owned
by the Duke of Devonshire. It is said also that
many of the French costumes and laces of her
wardrobe were appropriated by Queen Elizabeth,
who had little sympathy for the unfortunate
queen. As a solace during long days of loneliness,
Queen Mary found consolation in her needle, as
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg&nbsp;41]</a></span>
have many women of lower degree before and since
her unhappy time. She stands forth as the most
expert and indefatigable of royal needleworkers.</p>

<p>Hardwick Hall is intimately associated with
Queen Mary&rsquo;s life, and is rich in relics of her industry.
In one room named for her there are bed
curtains and a quilt said to be her own work. Extracts
from old letters relating to her conduct during
captivity show how devoted she was to her
needlework. An attendant, on being asked how
the queen passed her time, wrote, &ldquo;that all day
she wrought with her nydil and that the diversity
of the colours made the work seem less tedious and
that she contynued so long at it that veray payn
made hir to give over.&rdquo; This shows that fatigue
alone made her desist from her beloved work.</p>

<p>There is a very interesting fragment of a bed
hanging at Hardwick Hall said to have been made
by Queen Mary. It is of applied patchwork, with
cream-coloured medallions curiously ornamented
by means of designs singed with a hot iron upon
the light-coloured velvet. The singed birds,
flowers, and butterflies are outlined with black silk
thread. The worked medallions are applied to a
foundation of green velvet, ornamented between
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg&nbsp;42]</a></span>
and around them with yellow silk cord. This is
only one of a number of examples of curious and
beautiful patchwork still in existence and attributed
to the Tudor period.</p>

<p>Queen Elizabeth herself was not devoted to
needlework, but judging from the accounts of the
gorgeous costumes which she delighted to wear,
she was one of its greatest patronesses. It is said
that at her death she left one of the most extensive
wardrobes of history: in it were more than a thousand
dresses, which were most voluminous in style
and elaborately trimmed with bullion, pearls, and
jewels. Before the precious stones were applied,
her garments were solidly covered with gold and
silver quilting and embroidery, which made them
so heavy as to be a noticeable burden even for this
proud and ambitious queen. In Berkeley Castle,
as prized mementoes of Queen Elizabeth, are five
white linen cushions beautifully embroidered with
silver threads and cherry-coloured silk. Also
with them is the quilt, a wonderful piece of needlework,
that matches the hangings of the bed wherein
she slept.</p>

<p>The magnificence of Queen Elizabeth&rsquo;s reign
gave great impetus to all kinds of needlework.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg&nbsp;43]</a></span>
France at that time led in the development of fine
arts, and furnished many of the skilled workmen
employed by the nobility solely as embroiderers.
There seemed to be no limit to the ambitions of
these workers, and the gorgeous results of their
labours were beyond anything attempted after
them.</p>

<p>To those who wish to study the work of the
Tudor period, Hardwick Hall is recommended as
the place where the best specimens have been preserved.
To Elizabeth, daughter of John Hardwick,
born in 1520, and so poor that her marriage
portion as the bride of the Earl of Shrewsbury
was only thirty pounds, credit is given for the
richness of this collection. She was a woman of
great ability in the management of her estates,
became very wealthy, and gave employment to
many people. Included among her dependents
were many needleworkers who plied their trade under
rigorous administration. Elizabeth of Shrewsbury
was a hard mistress, but not above doing an
occasional bit of needlework herself, for some pieces
bearing her initials and done with remarkable skill
are preserved in the collection. She, as much as
any Englishwoman, fostered and developed applied
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg&nbsp;44]</a></span>
patchwork along the ambitious line of pictorial
needlework.</p>

<p>In Hardwick Hall are several hangings of pictorial
needlework that are very interesting. One
of black velvet has a picture of a lady strongly
resembling Queen Elizabeth. She carries a book
in her hand and at her feet reclines a turbaned
Turk. In the background is an ecclesiastical
hanging which is embroidered to represent a cathedral
window. The realistic effect of the whole
picture is gained by the use of coloured silks cut in
correct proportions and applied to the velvet
foundation; very little embroidery entering into
the main composition. Another hanging, also of
black velvet, has an even more ambitious design.
It is described by M. Jourdain in &ldquo;The History of
English Secular Embroidery&rdquo; as follows: &ldquo;The
ornamentation on the black velvet is with appliqu&eacute;
in coloured silks consisting of figures under arches.
In the centre is &lsquo;Lucrecia,&rsquo; on the left &lsquo;Chastite,&rsquo;
and on the right &lsquo;Liberalitas.&rsquo; The oval panel on
the right contains a shield bearing the arms of
Hardwick.&rdquo; At each end of the hanging are fluted
Ionic columns, and a decorated frieze is carried
across the top. The figures have grace and beauty;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg&nbsp;45]</a></span>
the drapery of their robes falls in natural folds; and
altogether it is a remarkable picture to have been
made with patches.</p>

<p>That this fine collection of medieval needlework
is preserved for the admiration of people to-day
is due to the faithful execution of the Countess of
Shrewsbury&rsquo;s will, in which she left all her household
furnishings, entailed as heirlooms, to always
remain in her House of Hardwick.</p>

<p>In the interesting Hardwick collection are pieces
of beautiful needlework known to have been used
by Mary, Queen of Scots, during the years she
spent as a prisoner at Tutbury. Her rooms there,
furnished in regal splendour, are still kept just
as she arranged them. The Earl of Shrewsbury
was her custodian, and his wife, the countess, often
sat and sewed with the unfortunate queen, both
making pastime of their needlework.</p>

<p>During the Middle Ages appliqu&eacute; was in universal
use, and not confined merely to wall hangings,
quilts, and bed draperies. It was used
to ornament all kinds of wearing apparel, including
caps, gloves, and shoes. Special designs
were made for upholstery, but because of the
hard wear imposed upon stools and chairs but
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg&nbsp;46]</a></span>
few specimens of this work have been preserved.</p>

<p>Quilting also came into vogue in the making of
bedspreads, of which great numbers were required
during the winter nights in the poorly heated bedrooms.
The quilts intended for service were made
of substantial, well-wearing material. None of
these strictly utilitarian quilts is left, but they
were certainly plentiful. The old chroniclers give
us a glimpse of what the women of these days
cherished by telling us that in 1540 Katherine
Howard, afterward wife of Henry VIII, was presented
with twenty-three quilts of Sarsenet, closely
quilted, from the Royal Wardrobe.</p>

<p>Tradition says that, during the reign of Henry
VIII, the much used and popular &ldquo;black work&rdquo; or
&ldquo;Spanish work&rdquo; was introduced into England by
his Spanish wife, Catherine of Aragon. It has been
found that this work did not originate in Spain but
was taken there probably by the Moors or by the
Crusaders, for it is known to have been perfected at
a very remote period in both Persia and China. The
following interesting description of black work is
from Mrs. Lowes&rsquo; &ldquo;Chats on Old Lace and Needlework&rdquo;:</p>

&ldquo;The work itself was a marvel of neatness,
precision, and elegant design, but the result cannot
be said to have been commensurate with the
labour of its production. More frequently the
design was of scrollwork, worked with a fine black
silk back stitching or chain stitch. Round and
round the stitches go, following each other closely.
Bunches of grapes are frequently worked solidly,
and even the popular peascod is worked in outline
stitch, and often the petit point period lace
stitches are copied, and roses and birds worked
separately and afterward stitched to the design.&rdquo;
There are many examples of this famous &ldquo;Spanish
work&rdquo; in the South Kensington Museum in London.
Quilts, hangings, coats, caps, jackets, smocks, are
all to be seen, some with a couched thread of gold
and silver following the lines of the scrolls. This
is said to be the Spanish stitch referred to in the
old list of stitches, and very likely may be so, as
the style and manner are certainly not English;
and we know that Catherine of Aragon brought
wonders of Spanish stitchery with her, and she
herself was devoted to the use of the needle. The
story of how, when called before Cardinal Wolsey
and Campeggio, to answer to King Henry&rsquo;s
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg&nbsp;48]</a></span>
accusations, she had a skein of embroidery silk round
her neck, is well known.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The black silk outline stitchery on linen lasted
well through the late seventeenth and eighteenth
centuries. Very little of it is seen outside the
museums, as, not being strikingly beautiful or
attractive, it has been destroyed. Another phase
of the same stitchery was working cotton and linen
garments, hangings and quilts in a kind of quilted
pattern with yellow silk. The finest materials
were used, the padding being placed bit by bit into
its place. The quilting work was made in tiny
panels, illustrating shields and other heraldic devices,
and had a surface as fine as carved ivory.
When, as in the case of one sample at South Kensington,
the quilt is additionally embroidered with
fine floss silk flowers, the effect is very lovely.&rdquo;</p>

<p>One interesting feature of &ldquo;black work&rdquo; and
similar flat embroideries was their constant use
in decorating furnishings for the bedroom. It was
peculiarly well adapted for quilts, as its rather
smooth surface admirably resisted wear.</p>

<p>Fashions in needlework changed, but not with
the same rapidity as in clothing. Gradually ideas
and customs from other countries crept into
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg&nbsp;49]</a></span>
England and new influences were felt. An established
trade with the Orient brought Eastern products
to her markets, and oriental designs in needlework
became popular. About this time &ldquo;crewel&rdquo; was
much in vogue. This was embroidery done with
coloured woollen threads and was a step backward
in the art. Some of this &ldquo;crewel&rdquo; work, done in
the seventeenth century, is described by M. Jourdain
in &ldquo;English Secular Embroidery&rdquo;: &ldquo;These
hangings, bed curtains, quilts, and valances are of
linen or a mixture of cotton and linen, and one type
is embroidered with bold, freely designed patterns
in worsted. They are worked almost always in dull
blues and greens mixed with more vivid greens and
some browns, but rarely any other colouring.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A very curious custom of these days was the use
of &ldquo;mourning beds,&rdquo; with black hangings, coverlets,
and even sheets. As these funereal articles
of furniture were quite expensive, it was a friendly
custom to lend these mourning beds to families in
time of affliction. In 1644 Mrs. Eure wrote to
Sir Ralph Verney: &ldquo;Sweet Nephew, I am now overrun
with miserys and troubles, but the greatest
misfortune that could happen to me was the death
of the gallantest man (her husband) that I ever
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg&nbsp;50]</a></span>
knew.&rdquo; Whereupon Sir Ralph, full of sympathy,
&ldquo;offers her the loan of the great black bed and
hangings from Claydon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Interesting indeed are descriptions of wonderful
old quilts that are now guarded with zealous care
in English museums. One, an original and striking
design, is closely quilted all over in small diamonds.
Upon it is embroidered an orange tree in
full leaf and loaded with fruit. This tree, together
with the fancy pot in which it is planted, covers
practically the entire quilt. In the lower corners
a gentleman is shown picking oranges and a lady
in a patient attitude is waiting to receive them, the
figures of both being scarcely taller than the flower
pot. The whole design is made up of gayly coloured
silks evidently worked in after the quilting was
done. Mention is also made of an elaborate quilt
said to be the work of Queen Anne, which is preserved
at Madresfield Court. Sarah, Duchess of
Marlborough, in giving an order for house furnishings
for her &ldquo;wild, unmerciful house&rdquo; about 1720,
asks for &ldquo;a vast number of feather beds, some filled
with swansdown, and a vast number of quilts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Delany, who lived from 1700 to 1788, and
left a large correspondence relating to needlework,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg&nbsp;51]</a></span>
which was later edited by Lady Llanover, was a
most prolific worker with her needle as well as a
profuse letter writer. She was often quoted as
an authority and given credit for much originality
in her designs. A quilt that she made is described
as follows: &ldquo;Of white linen worked in flowers, the
size of nature, delineated with the finest coloured
silks in running stitch, which is made use of in
the same way as by a pen etching on paper; the
outline was drawn with pencil. Each flower is
different, and evidently done at the moment from
the original.&rdquo; Another quilt of Mrs. Delany&rsquo;s
was made upon a foundation of nankeen. This
was unique in that no colours were used besides the
dull yellow of the background. Applied designs
of leaves tied together with ribbons, all cut from
white linen and stitched to the nankeen with
white thread, made a quilt no wise resembling the
silken ones of earlier periods. This quilt may be
termed a forerunner of the vast array of pieced
and patched washable quilts belonging to the nineteenth
century.</p>

<p>The embroidering of quilts followed the process
of quilting, which afforded the firm foundation
essential for heavy and elaborate designs. There
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg&nbsp;52]</a></span>
were many quilts made of white linen quilted with
yellow silk thread, and afterward embroidered
very tastefully with yellow silk floss. Terry, in
the history of his &ldquo;Voyage to the East Indies,&rdquo;
made about the middle of the seventeenth century,
says: &ldquo;The natives show very much ingenuity
in their manufactures, also in making excellent
quilts of their stained cloth, or of fresh-coloured
taffeta lined with their prints, or of their satin with
taffeta, betwixt which they put cotton wool, and
work them together with silk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Among many articles in a list of Eastern products,
which Charles I, in 1631, permitted to be
brought to England, were &ldquo;quilts of China embroidered
in Gold.&rdquo; There is a possibility that
these quilts were appreciated quite as much for
the precious metal used in the embroidery as for
the beauty of design and workmanship. It was
but a short time after this that women began to
realize how much gold and silver had gone into all
forms of needlework. They looked upon rare and
beautiful embroidery with greedy eyes, and a deplorable
fashion sprang up, known in France as
&ldquo;parfilage&rdquo; and in England as &ldquo;drizzling.&rdquo; This
was nothing more or less than ripping up, stitch
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg&nbsp;53]</a></span>
by stitch, the magnificent old hangings, quilts,
and even church vestments, to secure gold and
silver thread. Lady Mary Coke, writing from
the Austrian Court, says: &ldquo;All the ladies who do
not play cards pick gold. It is the most general
fashion I ever saw, and they all carry their bags
containing the necessary tools in their pockets.
They even begged sword knots, epaulettes, and
galons that they might add more of the precious
threads to the spool on which they wound the
ravelled bullion, which they sold.&rdquo; To the appreciative
collector this seems wanton sacrilege.</p>

<p>John Locke, 1632-1704, a very famous man of
Charles II&rsquo;s time, and one of the greatest philosophers
and ardent champions of civil and religious
rights which England ever produced,
mentioned quilts in his &ldquo;Thoughts Concerning
Education.&rdquo; In telling of the correct sort of beds
for children he writes as follows: &ldquo;Let his Bed be
hard, and rather Quilts than Feathers. Hard
Lodging strengthens the Parts, whereas being
buryed every Night in Feathers melts and dissolves
the Body.... Besides, he that is used to
hard Lodging at Home will not miss his Sleep
(where he has most Need of it) in his travels
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg&nbsp;54]</a></span>
Abroad for want of his soft Bed, and his Pillows
laid in Order.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Pepys, a contemporary of Locke, in his incomparable
and delicious Diary, remarks: &ldquo;Home to my
poor wife, who works all day like a horse, at the
making of her hanging for our chamber and bed,&rdquo;
thus telling us that he was following the fashion
of the day in having wall, window, and bed draperies
alike. It is plain, too, by his frequent &ldquo;and
so to bed,&rdquo; that his place of sleep and rest was one
of comfort in his house.</p>

<p>A quilt depending solely upon the stitching used
in quilting, whether it be of the simple running
stitch, the back stitch, or the chain stitch, is not
particularly ornamental. However, when viewed
at close range, the effect is a shadowy design in
low relief that has a distinctive but modest beauty
when well done. Early in the eighteenth century
a liking for this fashion prevailed, and was put to
a variety of uses. Frequently there was no interlining
between the right and wrong sides. At
Canons Ashby there are now preserved some handsome
quilted curtains of this type, belonging to
Sir Alfred Dryden, Baronet.</p>

<p>During the Middle Ages instruction in the use
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg&nbsp;55]</a></span>
of the needle was considered a necessary part of
the English girl&rsquo;s education. By the seventeenth
century &ldquo;working fine works with the needle&rdquo;
was considered of equal importance with singing,
dancing, and French in the accomplishments of a
lady of quality. In the eighteenth century much
the same sentiment prevailed, and Lady Montagu
is quoted as saying: &ldquo;It is as scandalous for a
woman not to know how to use a needle as for a
man not to know how to use a sword.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The <i>Spectator</i> of that time sarcastically tells of
two sisters highly educated in domestic arts who
spend so much time making cushions and &ldquo;sets
of hangings&rdquo; that they had never learned to read
and write! A sober-minded old lady, grieved by
frivolous nieces, begs the <i>Spectator</i> &ldquo;to take the
laudable mystery of embroidery into your serious
consideration,&rdquo; for, says she, &ldquo;I have two nieces,
who so often run gadding abroad that I do not
know when to have them. Those hours which, in
this age, are thrown away in dress, visits, and the
like, were employed in my time in writing out receipts,
or working beds, chairs, and hangings for
the family. For my part I have plied the needle
these fifty years, and by my good-will would never
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg&nbsp;56]</a></span>
have it out of my hand. It grieves my heart to
see a couple of proud, idle flirts sipping the tea
for a whole afternoon in a room hung round with
the industry of their great-grandmothers.&rdquo; Another
old lady of the eighteenth century, Miss
Hutton, proudly makes the following statement
of the results of years of close application to the
needle: &ldquo;I have quilted counterpanes and chest
covers in fine white linen, in various patterns of
my own invention. I have made patchwork beyond
calculation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Emblems and motifs were great favourites with
the quilt workers of &ldquo;ye olden times&rdquo; and together
with mottoes were worked into many pieces of
embroidery. The following mottoes were copied
from an old quilt made in the seventeenth century:
&ldquo;Covet not to wax riche through deceit,&rdquo; &ldquo;He
that has lest witte is most poore,&rdquo; &ldquo;It is better to
want riches than witte,&rdquo; &ldquo;A covetous man cannot
be riche.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The needle and its products have always been
held in great esteem in England, and many of the
old writers refer to needlework with much respect.
In 1640 John Taylor, sometimes called the &ldquo;Water
Poet,&rdquo; published a collection of essays, etc., called
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg&nbsp;57]</a></span>
&ldquo;The Needle&rsquo;s Excellency,&rdquo; which was very popular
in its day and ran through twelve editions.
In it is a long poem entitled, &ldquo;The Prayse of the
Needle.&rdquo; The following are the opening lines:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;To all dispersed sorts of Arts and Trades<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I write the needles prayse (that never fades)<br /></span>

<p>It is interesting to read what Elizabeth Glaister,
an Englishwoman, writes of quilts in England:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps no piece of secular needlework gave
our ancestors more satisfaction, both in the making
and when made, as the quilt or bed coverlet. We
have seen a good many specimens of them, both of
the real quilted counterpanes, in which several
thicknesses of material were stitched together into
a solid covering, and the lighter silken or linen
coverlets ornamented with all sorts of embroidery.
Cradle quilts also were favourite pieces of needlework
and figure in inventories of Henry VIII&rsquo;s time.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg&nbsp;58]</a></span>
&ldquo;The real quilts were very handsome and the
amount of labour bestowed on them was enormous.
The seventeenth century was a great time for
them, and the work of this period is generally
very good. The quilting of some of them is made
by sewing several strands of thick cotton between
the fine linen of the surface and the lining. When
one line was completed the cotton was laid down
again next to it, and another line formed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A sort of shell pattern was a favourite for quilting.
When a sufficient space was covered with
the ground pattern, flowers or other ornaments
were embroidered on this excellent foundation.
Perhaps the best results as a work of art were attained
when both quilting and flowers were done
in bright yellow silk; the effect of this colour on a
white ground being always particularly good. A
handsome quilt may be worked with a darned
background. It is done most easily on huckaback
towelling of rather loose weave, running the needle
under the raised threads for the ground.</p>

crewels in buttonhole stitch; stems, veins, and
buds being also worked in crewels, and the ground
slightly darned in dim yellow crewel. It is elaborate,
but a very pleasant and repaying piece of
work.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Many beautiful old quilts are made of silk and
satin embroidered in pure silks or in gold and silver
twist. Most of the best specimens are from
France and Italy, where from the arrangement of
the houses the beds have continued to be more
<i>en evidence</i> than has been the case in England for
the last two centuries. Many also are of Indian
origin; the ground of these is sometimes of fine soft
silk and sometimes of thick muslin, over which
the pattern is worked in silk. Others, though of
Indian workmanship, show a European influence,
of which the most curious are those worked at
Goa, under Portuguese dominion in the seventeenth
century.&rdquo;</p>

were considered as such ordinary articles that the
early writers about family life in the colonies

<p>Extensive investigation has shown that the introduction
of the arts of patchwork and quilting
to the American continent is due entirely to the
English and the Dutch. No evidence has been
found that Spanish or French colonists made use
of quilting. The Spaniards in the warm lands of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg&nbsp;61]</a></span>
the South had little real need of warm clothing, and&mdash;outside
of possible appliqu&eacute; heraldic devices on
the coats of the early explorers&mdash;may be considered
as having brought to the New World none
of the art so popular in Spain at the time. The
French who opened up Canada brought none of
the quilting or patchwork of France with them.
While needlework was taught at a very early date
in the convents of Quebec, it was apparently only
the more fanciful kinds of embroidery. As a protection
against the biting northern winters, the
early French settlers sought protection under furs,
which could be obtained quite readily in the great
woods. To secure more bed clothing, it was very
much easier to engage in a little hunting than to
go through the laborious processes of piecing and
quilting. To both Spanish and French, the new
world was strictly a man&rsquo;s country&mdash;to adventure
in and win riches upon which to retire to a life of
ease in their native lands. With them, therefore,
the inspiration of founding a home and providing
it with the comforts of life was lacking; and without
such inspiration the household arts could never
flourish.</p>

<p>The English and Dutch planted their colonies
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg&nbsp;62]</a></span>
along the coast from Virginia to Massachusetts
with the primary object of founding new homes for
themselves. With them came their wives and
daughters, who brought along as their portion such
household comforts and conveniences as they possessed.
Under their willing hands spinning, weaving,
and the manufacture of garments began
immediately. Their poorly heated log houses made
necessary an adequate supply of bedding and
hangings for protection against the winter cold.
Substantial, heavy curtains, frequently lined and
quilted, were hung over both doors and windows
and were kept closely drawn during the bitter winter
nights. In the more imposing homes were silk
damask curtains with linings of quilted silk to keep
out the drafts of cold that swept through the rooms.</p>

<p>In Massachusetts in the early colonial days
quilted garments, especially petticoats, were in general
use. It is a curious circumstance that we
owe this bit of information largely to the description
of runaway slaves. The Boston <i>News Letter</i>
of October, 1707, contains an advertisement describing
an Indian woman who ran away, clad in
the best garments she could purloin from her mistress&rsquo;s
wardrobe: &ldquo;A tall Lusty Carolina Indian
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg&nbsp;63]</a></span>
Woman, named Keziah Wampun Had on a striped
red, blue and white Home-spun Jacket and a Red
one, a Black and quilted White Silk Crape Petticoat,
a White Shift and also a blue with her, and a
mixt Blue and White Linsey Woolsey Apron.&rdquo;
In 1728 the <i>News Letter</i> published an advertisement
of a runaway Indian servant who, wearied by the
round of domestic drudgery, adorned herself in
borrowed finery and fled: &ldquo;She wore off a Narrow
Stript pinck cherredary Gown turned up with
a little floured red and white Callico. A Stript
Home-spun quilted petticoat, a plain muslin Apron,
a suit of plain Pinners and a red and white flowered
knot, also a pair of green stone earrings, with
white cotton stockings and leather heel&rsquo;d wooden
shoes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A few items in a list of articles ordered from England
for a New England bride, Miss Judith Sewall,
who was married in 1720, give some idea of what
was considered as a suitable wedding outfit during
that period. The bride belonged to a rich family
and no doubt had furnishings much more extensive
than usual: &ldquo;A Duzen of good Black Walnut
Chairs, A Duzen Cane Chairs, and a great chair
for a chamber, all black Walnut. One Duzen large
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg&nbsp;64]</a></span>
Pewter Plates, new fashion, a Duzen Ivory-hafted
knives and forks. Four Duzen small glass salt cellars,
Curtains and Vallens for a Bed with Counterpane,
Head Cloth, and Tester made of good yellow
watered camlet with Trimming. Send also of the
same camlet and trimming as may be enough to
make cushions for the chamber chairs. A good
fine larger Chintz quilt, well made.&rdquo; This list
also includes such items as kitchen utensils, warming
pans, brass fenders, tongs, and shovels, and
&ldquo;four pairs of large Brass candlesticks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As the resources of the new country were developed,
the women were given some respite from
their spinning, weaving, and garment making.
Much of their hard-won leisure was spent piecing
quilts. In the rigorous climate of bleak New England
there was great need of warm clothing and
bedding, and the spare moments of the housekeeper
were largely occupied in increasing her supply.
To make the great amount of bedding necessary
in the unheated sleeping rooms, every scrap and
remnant of woollen material left from the manufacture
of garments was saved. To supplement
these, the best parts of worn-out garments were
carefully cut out, and made into quilt pieces.</p>

Beautiful, even gorgeous, materials were imported
for costumes of the wives and daughters of
the wealthy colonists. There may be a greater
variety of fabrics woven to-day, but none is more
splendid in texture and colour than those worn by
the stately ladies of colonial times. The teachings
of the strict Puritans advocated plainness and simplicity
of dress; even the ministers in the churches
preached against the &ldquo;sinfulness of display of fine
raiment.&rdquo; Notwithstanding the teachings and
pleadings of the clergy, there was great rivalry in
dress among the inhabitants of the larger colonial
towns. &ldquo;Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,&rdquo;
was unnecessary advice to give to the rich colonist
or to his wife. Men&rsquo;s attire was also of costly velvets
lined with handsome brocades; beautifully
embroidered waistcoats, silk stockings, and gold
lace trimmings were further additions to their costumes
during the pre-Revolutionary period.</p>

<p>After these gay and costly fabrics had served
their time as wearing apparel, they were carefully
preserved and made over into useful articles for the
household. The pinch of hard times during the
struggle for independence made it imperative for
many well-to-do families to economize.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg&nbsp;66]</a></span>
Consequently, in many old patchwork quilts may be
found bits of the finest silks, satins, velvets, and
brocades, relics of more prosperous days.</p>

<p>Alice Morse Earle, in her charming book on
&ldquo;Home Life in Colonial Days,&rdquo; gives us a rare insight
into our great-grandmothers&rsquo; fondness for
patchwork, and how highly they prized their bits
of highly coloured fabrics:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The feminine love of colour, the longing for
decoration, as well as pride in skill of needlecraft,
found riotous expression in quilt making. Women
revelled in intricate and difficult patchwork; they
eagerly exchanged patterns with one another; they
talked over the designs, and admired pretty bits of
calico and pondered what combinations to make,
with far more zest than women ever discuss art
or examine high art specimens together to-day.
There was one satisfactory condition in the work,
and that was the quality of cottons and linens
of which the patchwork was made. Real India
chintzes and palampores are found in these quilts,
beautiful and artistic stuffs, and the firm, unyielding,
high-priced, &lsquo;real&rsquo; French calicoes.</p>

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg&nbsp;67]</a></span>
and well-worn petticoats were component parts of
quilts that were needed for warmth. A magnificent
scarlet cloak, worn by a Lord Mayor of London
and brought to America by a member of the
Merrit family of Salisbury, Massachusetts, went
through a series of adventures and migrations and
ended its days as small bits of vivid colour, casting
a grateful glory and variety on a patchwork
quilt in the Saco Valley of Maine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Around the outstretched quilt a dozen quilters
could sit, running the whole together with fanciful
set designs of stitchery. Sometimes several quilts
were set up, and I know of a ten days&rsquo; quilting bee
in Narragansett in 1752.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The women who came from Holland to make
their homes on the narrow island at the mouth
of the Hudson were housekeepers of traditional
Dutch excellence. They delighted in well-stocked
linen closets and possessed unusual quantities of
sheets, pillow cases, and bedding, mostly of their
own spinning and weaving. Like their English
neighbours to the north, in Connecticut and Massachusetts,
they adopted quilted hangings and garments
for protection against the severity of winter.
Their quilted petticoats were the pride and joy of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg&nbsp;68]</a></span>
these transplanted Hollanders, and in their construction
they exerted their highest talents in
design and needlework. These petticoats, which
were worn short enough to display the home-knitted
hose, were thickly interlined as well as
quilted. They were very warm, as the interlining
was usually of wool. The fuller the purse, the
richer and gayer were the petticoats of the New
Amsterdam dames.</p>

<p>While not so strict in religious matters as their
Puritan neighbours, the early inhabitants of New
Amsterdam always observed Sunday and attended
church regularly. Within the fort at the battery
stood the church, built of &ldquo;Manhattan Stone&rdquo; in
1642. Its two peaked roofs with the watch-tower
between was the most prominent object of the
fortress. &ldquo;On Sunday mornings the two main
streets, Broadway and Whitehall, were filled with
dignified and sedate churchgoers arrayed in their
best clothes. The tucked-up panniers worn by
the women displayed to the best advantage the
quilted petticoats. Red, blue, black, and white
were the favourite and predominating colours,
and the different materials included fine woollen
cloth, camlet, grosgrain silk, and satin. Of all the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg&nbsp;69]</a></span>
articles of feminine attire of that period the quilted
petticoat was the most important. They were
worn short, displaying the low shoes with high
heels and coloured hose with scarlet clockings;
silken hoods partially covered their curled and
powdered hair; altogether a charming and delightful
picture.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The low, flat land of South Manhattan lying
along the Hudson, because of its similarity to their
mother country, was a favourite dwelling-place in
New Netherlands. This region, known as Flatbush,
was quickly covered with Dutch homes and
big, orderly, flourishing gardens. A descendant
of one of the oldest Dutch families which settled
in this locality, Mrs. Gertrude Lefferts Vanderbilt,
in her book, &ldquo;The Social History of Flatbush,&rdquo;
has given many interesting details of early New
York life. She tells of the place quilt making
held in the community, and how the many intricate
patterns of patchwork pleasantly occupied
the spare moments of the women, thus serving as
a means of expression of their love of colour and
design. The following little domestic picture
shows how conveniently near the thrifty housewife
kept her quilt blocks: &ldquo;A low chair with a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg&nbsp;70]</a></span>
seat of twisted osier, on which was tied a loose
feather-filled cushion, covered with some gay material.
On the back of these chairs hung the bag
of knitting, with the little red stocking and shining
needles plainly visible, indicating that this was
the favourite seat of the industrious mother of the
family; or a basket of patchwork held its place
upon a low stool (bankje) beside the chair, also
to be snatched up at odd intervals (ledige tyd).&rdquo;</p>

<p>One reliable source of information of the comforts
and luxuries that contributed to pleasant
dwelling in old New York is found in old inventories
of household effects. Occasionally complete
lists are found that throw much light on the furnishings
of early days. Such an inventory of the
household belongings of Captain John Kidd, before
he went to sea and turned pirate, mentions over
sixty different kinds of house furnishings, from a
skillet to a dozen chairs embellished with Turkish
embroidery. Among the articles with which John
Kidd and his wife Sarah began housekeeping in
New York in 1692, as recorded in this inventory,
were four bedsteads, with three suits of hangings,
curtains, and valances to go with them. Feather
beds, feather pillows, linen sheets, tablecloths, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg&nbsp;71]</a></span>
napkins, ten blankets, and three quilts. How
much of this store of household linens was part of
his wife&rsquo;s wedding dower is not stated.</p>

<p>The early settlers in Virginia and the Carolinas
were mostly English of the better class, who had
been landed proprietors with considerable retinues
of servants. As soon as these original colonists
secured a firm foothold, large estates were developed
on which the manners and customs of old
England were followed as closely as possible. Each
plantation became a self-supporting community,
since nearly all the actual necessities were produced
or manufactured thereon. The loom worked ceaselessly,
turning the wool, cotton, and flax into
household commodities, and even the shoes for both
slave and master were made from home-tanned
leather. For their luxuries, the ships that carried
tobacco and rice to the English markets returned
laden with books, wines, laces, silverware,
and beautiful house furnishings of every description.</p>

<p>In the colonial plantation days of household
industry quilts, both patchwork and plain, were
made in considerable numbers. Quilts were then
in such general use as to be considered too commonplace
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg&nbsp;72]</a></span>
to be described or even mentioned. Consequently,
we are forced to depend for evidence of
their existence in those days on bills of sale and
inventories of auctions. These records, however,
constitute an authority which cannot be questioned.</p>

<p>In 1774 Belvoir, the home of the Fairfax family,
one of the largest and most imposing of houses of
Virginia, was sold and its contents were put up at
auction. A partial list of articles bought at this
sale by George Washington, then Colonel Washington,
and here given, will show the luxury to which
the Southern planter was accustomed: &ldquo;A mahogany
shaving desk, settee bed and furnishings,
four mahogany chairs, oval glass with gilt frame,
mahogany sideboard, twelve chairs, and three
window curtains from dining-room. Several pairs
of andirons, tongs, shovels, toasting forks, pickle
pots, wine glasses, pewter plates, many blankets,
pillows, bolsters, and <em>nineteen coverlids</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="incaption" style="padding-bottom: 3em;">For a child&rsquo;s bed</p>

<p>It was customary in the good old days after a
dinner or ball for the guests, who necessarily came
from long distances, to stay all night, and many
bedrooms, frequently from ten to twenty-five,
besides those needed for the family, were provided
in the big houses. All were beautifully furnished
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg&nbsp;73]</a></span>
with imported, massive, carved furniture from
France and England. In one year, 1768, in Charlestown,
South Carolina, occurred twelve weddings
among the wealthy residents of that city, and all
the furniture for these rich couples came from
England. The twelve massive beds with canopies
supported by heavily carved posts, decorated with
rice stalks and full heads of grain, were so high
that steps were needed in order to climb into them.
Elaborate and expensive curtains and spreads
were furnished to correspond. In one early inventory
of an extensively furnished house there are
mentioned &ldquo;four feather beds, bolsters, two stools,
looking-glass tipt with silver, two Turkey carpets,
one yellow mohair bed counterpane, and <em>two green
silk quilts</em>.&rdquo; From this it is evident that the
quilt had already found its place, and no doubt in
great numbers, on account of the many beds to
furnish in the spacious house of the rich planters.</p>

<p>Shortly after the Revolution came the great
migration from Virginia over the ridges of the
Blue and the Appalachian chains into what was
then the wilderness of Tennessee and Kentucky.
The descendants of these hardy pioneers who first
forced their way westward still live among the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg&nbsp;74]</a></span>
Kentucky and Virginia hills under the conditions
which prevailed a hundred years ago. In this
heavily timbered rough country they manage to
eke out a precarious existence by cultivating small
hillside patches of cotton, corn, and a few vegetables.
Immured in the seclusion of the mountains
they have remained untouched by the world&rsquo;s
progress during the past century. Year after
year they are satisfied to live this secluded existence,
and but rarely make an acquaintance with a
stranger. Educational advantages, except of the
most elementary sort, are almost unknown, and
the majority of these mountaineers neither read
nor write. As a result of this condition of isolated
and primitive living, existing in the mountains of
Virginia, Kentucky, Tennessee, and the Carolinas,
the household crafts that flourished in this country
before the advent of machinery are still carried
on exactly as in the old days.</p>

<p>The simple needs of the family are almost entirely
supplied by the women of the household.
They spin, weave, and make the few plain garments
which they and their families wear. Day after day,
year in and year out, these isolated women must
fill in the hours with little tasks connected with
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg&nbsp;75]</a></span>
home life. As in many other instances where women
are dependent upon their own resources for
amusement, they have recourse to their needles.
Consequently, it is in the making of quilts, coverlets,
and allied forms of needlework that these mountain
women spend their hours of recreation.</p>

<p>The quilts, both pieced and patched, that are
made in mountaineers&rsquo; cabins have a great variety
of designs. Many designs have been used again
and again by each succeeding generation of quilters
without any variation whatever, and have well-known
names. There are also designs that have
been originated by a proficient quilt maker, who has
made use of some common flower as the basis for her
conventional design. It has not been a great many
years since the materials used in making the mountain
quilts were dyed as well as woven in the home.
The dyes were homemade from common roots and
shrubs gathered from nearby woods and meadows.
Blue was obtained from wild indigo; brown from
walnut hulls; black from the bark of scrub-oak; and
yellow from laurel leaves. However, the materials
which must be purchased for a quilt are so
meagre, and the colours called &ldquo;oil boiled&rdquo;&mdash;now
used to dye calico&mdash;are so fast, that the mountain
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg&nbsp;76]</a></span>
women seldom dye their own fabrics any more.
They bring in a few chickens or eggs to the nearest
village, and in exchange obtain a few yards of
precious coloured calico for their quilts.</p>

<p>Miss Bessie Daingerfield, a Kentuckian, who
is in close touch with these mountaineers, tells us
what a void the quilt fills in the lives of the lonely
women of the hills: &ldquo;While contemporary women
out in the world are waging feminist war, those in
the mountains of the long Appalachian chain still
sit at their quilting frames and create beauty and
work wonders with patient needles. There is much
beautiful and skilful handiwork hidden away in
these hills. The old women still weave coverlets,
towels, and table linen from wool from their own
sheep and from flax grown in their own gardens.
The girls adorn their cotton gowns with &lsquo;compass
work,&rsquo; exact, exquisite. In some places the men
and boys, girls and women, make baskets of hickory
reeds and willows to delight the heart of the collector.
But from the cradle to the grave, the women
make quilts. The tiny girl shows you with
pride the completed four patch or nine patch,
square piled on square, which &lsquo;mammy aims to set
up for her ag&rsquo;inst spring.&rsquo; The mother tells you
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg&nbsp;77]</a></span>
half jesting, half in earnest, &lsquo;the young un will
have several ag&rsquo;inst she has a home of her own.&rsquo;
No bride of the old country has more pride in her
dower chest than the mountain bride in her pile of
quilts. The old woman will show you a stack of
quilts from floor to ceiling of her cabin. One dear
old soul told me she had eighty-four, all different,
and &lsquo;ever&rsquo; stitch, piecin&rsquo;, settin&rsquo; up, quiltin&rsquo;, my
own work and ne&rsquo;er another finger tetched hit.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Patchwork was an important factor in making
plain the knotty problems of existence, as Eliza
Calvert Hall clearly shows when she makes &ldquo;Aunt
Jane of Kentucky&rdquo; say: &ldquo;How much piecin&rsquo; a
quilt is like livin&rsquo; a life! Many a time I&rsquo;ve set and
listened to Parson Page preachin&rsquo; about predestination
and free will, and I&rsquo;ve said to myself, &lsquo;If I
could jest git up in the pulpit with one of my quilts
I could make it a heap plainer to folks than parson&rsquo;s
makin&rsquo; it with his big words.&rsquo; You see, you
start out with jest so much caliker; you don&rsquo;t go
to the store and pick it out and buy it, but the
neighbours will give you a piece here and a piece
there, and you&rsquo;ll have a piece left over every time
you cut a dress, and you take jest what happens to
come. And that&rsquo;s like predestination. But when
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg&nbsp;78]</a></span>
it comes to the cuttin&rsquo; out, why, you&rsquo;re free to
choose your own pattern. You can give the same
kind o&rsquo; pieces to two persons, and one&rsquo;ll make a
&lsquo;nine patch&rsquo; and one&rsquo;ll make a &lsquo;wild-goose chase,&rsquo;
and there&rsquo;ll be two quilts made out of the same kind
of pieces, and jest as different as they can be. And
that is jest the way with livin&rsquo;. The Lord sends
us the pieces, but we can cut them out and put
&rsquo;em together pretty much to suit ourselves, and
there&rsquo;s a heap more in the cuttin&rsquo; out and the sewin&rsquo;
than there is in the caliker.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the great Central West, from Ohio to the
Mississippi, the early settlers passed through the
same cycle of development as did their ancestors
in the beginnings of the original colonies along the
seaboard. The same dangers and privations were
faced, and the women, as well as the men, quickly
adapted themselves to the hardships of life in a
new country. Shortly after the War of 1812,
which secured to the United States a clear title to
this vast region, the great migration into the Ohio
Valley began. Some families came by way of the
Great Lakes, some by wagon over the Pennsylvania
ridges, and still others by horseback over the
mountains from Virginia. One and all of these
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg&nbsp;79]</a></span>
pioneer families brought with them their most
cherished household possessions. It is hardly
necessary to say that every family had one or more
quilts among its household goods. Many cases
are on record of rare old mahogany bureaus and
bedsteads transported hundreds of miles over trails
through the wilderness on pack horses. Upon arrival
at the site chosen for the future home, the
real work of house building and furnishing began.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only he who knows what it means to hew a
home out of the forest; of what is involved in the
task of replacing mighty trees with corn; only he
who has watched the log house rising in the clearing,
and has witnessed the devotedness that gathers
around the old log schoolhouse and the pathos of
a grave in the wilderness, can understand how
sobriety, decency, age, devoutness, beauty, and
power belong to the story of those who began the
mighty task of changing the wild west into the
heart of a teeming continent.&rdquo; Thus Jenkin Lloyd
Jones, in his address on &ldquo;The Father of Lincoln,&rdquo;
gives a graphic picture of the labours and trials
confronting those who made the first settlements
in what are now the flourishing states of Ohio, Indiana,
Kentucky, Illinois, and Michigan.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg&nbsp;80]</a></span>
As in the colonies of New England, so here, the
comforts of the family depended upon the thrift,
energy, and thoughtfulness of the women. Practically
every article of clothing worn by the entire
family, as well as all household supplies, were the
work of their busy hands. All day in the frontier
cabin could be heard the hum of the spinning
wheel, the clack of the loom, or the click of knitting
needles. In many localities the added work of
teaching the children fell to the mothers, and the
home lessons given around the fireplace, heaped
with glowing logs, were the only ones possible for
many boys and girls. It is of particular interest
to note how often learning and housekeeping went
hand in hand in the first homes of this new country.
The few lines following are extracts from the
diary of a busy Indiana housewife of the period
preceding the Mexican War, and show how
fully occupied was the time of the pioneer
woman:</p>

<p>In the Middle West, without friendly co&ouml;peration,
the lot of the pioneer would have been much
more difficult than it was. Julia Henderson
Levering tells of the prevalence of this kindly
custom in her interesting &ldquo;Historic Indiana&rdquo;:
&ldquo;The social pleasures of the earliest days were
largely connected with the helpful neighbourhood
assistance in the homely, necessary tasks of the
frontier. If a new cabin was to be built, the
neighbours assembled for the house raising, for
the logs were too heavy to be handled alone. When
a clearing was made, the log rolling followed. All
men for miles around came to help, and the women
to help cook and serve the bountiful meals. Then
there were corn huskings, wool shearings, apple
parings, sugar boilings, and quilting bees.&rdquo;</p>

<p>About 1820 a new channel of commerce was
opened to the inhabitants of the Ohio Valley, in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg&nbsp;82]</a></span>
the advantages of which every household shared.
This was the establishing of steamboat and flatboat
communication with New Orleans. From
out of the Wabash River alone over a thousand
flatboats, laden with agricultural products, passed
into the Ohio during the annual spring rise on their
way to the seaport by the Gulf of Mexico. On their
return voyage these boats were laden with sacks of
coffee, quaint Chinese boxes of tea, china and silk
from France, and mahogany and silver from England.
In this manner the finest fabrics, which were
hitherto obtainable only in those cities that possessed
sea communication, were available in every
river hamlet. Many of the fine old quilts now
being brought to light in the Central West were
wrought of foreign cloth which has made this
long journey in some farmer&rsquo;s scow.</p>

<p>In England during the middle of the past century,
the Victorian period was known chiefly for
its hideous array of cardboard mottoes done in
brilliant wools, crochet tidies, and wax flowers.
It is particularly fortunate that at this time the
women of the United States were too fully occupied
with their own household arts and industries to
take up with the ideas of their English sisters.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg&nbsp;83]</a></span>
By far the best needlework of this period were the
beautiful quilts and bedspreads, exquisite in colour
and design, which were the product of American
women. The finest quilts were wrought along
designs largely original with the quilters themselves,
who plied their needles in solitary farmhouses
and out-of-the-way hamlets to which the
influence of English idea in needlework could not
penetrate. In no locality in our country can so
many rare and beautiful quilts be found as in the
Middle West. Many of the best were made during
those early days of struggle for mere existence,
when they served the busy housewife as the one
precious outlet for her artistic aspirations.</p>

<p>The type of quilt that may be called distinctively
American was substantial in character; the material
that entered into its construction was serviceable,
of a good quality of cotton cloth, or
handwoven linen, and the careful work put into it
was intended to stand the test of time. The coloured
materials combined with the white were also
enduring, the colours being as nearly permanent as
it was possible to procure. Some cottons were
dyed by the quilt makers themselves, if desirable
fast shades could not be readily procured otherwise.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg&nbsp;84]</a></span>
The fundamental idea was to make a quilt
that would withstand the greatest possible amount
of wear. Some of the artistic possibilities in both
colour and design were often subordinated to the
desire to make quilts as nearly imperishable as
possible. The painstaking needlework required to
produce a quilt deserved the best of material for its
foundation. Silks, satins, velvets, and fine linen
and cotton fabrics of delicate shades were not
favoured as quilt material by the old-time needleworkers,
who wrought for service first and beauty
afterward.</p>

<p>A most beautiful example of the American quilt
at its best is found in the &ldquo;Indiana Wreath.&rdquo; Its
pleasing design, harmonious colours, and exquisite
workmanship reveal to us the quilter&rsquo;s art in its
greatest perfection. This quilt was made by Miss
E.&nbsp;J. Hart, a most versatile and skilful needlewoman,
in 1858, as shown by the small precise
figures below the large wreath. The design is
exceedingly well balanced in that the entire quilt
surface is uniformly covered and no one feature is
emphasized to the detriment of any other. The
design element of the wreath is a compact group
of flowers, fruit, and leaves, which is repeated ten
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg&nbsp;85]</a></span>
times in making the complete circle. The vase
filled with drooping sprays, flowers, and conventionalized
buds forms an ideal centre for this
wreath. Curving vines intermingled with flowers
make a desirable and graceful border. This quilt
is a little more than two and a half yards square,
and the central wreath fills a space equal to the
width of a double bed, for which it was evidently
intended.</p>

<p>Miss Hart displayed unusual ability in choosing
and combining the limited materials at the disposal
of the quilt maker in a newly settled region.
The foundation is fine white muslin; the coloured
material is calico, in the serviceable quality manufactured
at that time, and of shades considered
absolutely fast, then known as &ldquo;oil boiled.&rdquo; Only
four colours are used in the design: green, red,
yellow, and pink, the latter having a small allover
printed design in a darker shade.</p>

<p>Miss Hart planned her quilting quite carefully.
In the large blank spaces in the corners are placed
special, original designs that have some features
of the much-used &ldquo;feather&rdquo; pattern. Aside from
these triangular corner designs all the quilting is in
small diamonds, which form a very pleasing
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg&nbsp;86]</a></span>
background for the effective coloured designs. The
maker&rsquo;s name and the date are closely quilted in
white in plain bold-faced type just below the
wreath. In the centre of the wreath, in neat script
in black thread, is quilted the name &ldquo;Indiana
Wreath,&rdquo; and all the stitchery of top and quilting
is the very perfection of quilt making.</p>

<p>The beautiful white quilts that are treasured
as relics of past industry by their fortunate owners
deserve special mention. They are rare because
nowadays no one will expend the large amount of
time necessary to complete one. The foundation
of such a quilt is fine white muslin, or fine homespun
and woven linen, with a very thin interlining.
The beauty of the quilt depends upon the design
drawn for the quilting and the fine stitches with
which the quilting is done. There is usually a
special design planned for these white quilts which
includes a large central panel or pattern, with
smaller designs for the corners embodying some
of the ideas of the central panel. Around these
decorative sections the background is so closely
quilted as to resemble a woven fabric. This
smooth, even background throws the principal
designs into low relief. After the entire quilt is
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg&nbsp;87]</a></span>
quilted and removed from the frames, the main
design is frequently further accentuated by having
all the most prominent features, such as the leaves
and petals of flowers, stuffed. To accomplish
this tiny holes are made on the wrong side of each
section of the design and cotton is pushed in with
a large needle until the section is stuffed full and
tight. This tedious process is followed until every
leaf and petal stands out in bold relief.</p>

<p class="incaption" style="padding-bottom: 3em;">This is applied patchwork and therefore much more easily made than pieced

<p>The fashion which has prevailed for many years
of dressing beds all in white has no doubt caused
the destruction of many beautiful quilts. The
white quilts that have been preserved are now considered
too valuable to be subjected to hard wear.
The most exquisite ones were made in the last of
the eighteenth and the beginning of the nineteenth
centuries.</p>

<p>It was the rage for white bed coverings that
shortened the lives of many old pieced and patched
quilts of good colouring. The &ldquo;Country Contributor&rdquo;
tells of her experiences in dressing up the
white beds:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I remember with regret the quilts I wore out,
using them white side up in lieu of white Marseilles
spreads. The latter we were far too poor to own;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg&nbsp;88]</a></span>
the &lsquo;tufted&rsquo; ones had worn out; and I loathed the
cheap &lsquo;honeycombed&rsquo; cotton things we were forced
to use unless we were going to be frankly &lsquo;poor&rsquo;
and cover our beds with plain patchwork, made
up hurriedly and quilted in simple &lsquo;fans&rsquo; in plebeian
squares, as poor folk who haven&rsquo;t time for
elegant stitches did theirs. So I used the old
quilts, making their fine stitches in intricate patterns
serve for the design in a &lsquo;white spread,&rsquo; turning
the white muslin lining up. A beautiful
white spread it made, too, I realize now, more fully
than I did then, though I now would know much
better than to turn the wonderful appliqu&eacute; stars
and flowers and wheels from view. Strange, is it
not, that we relinquish so much of life&rsquo;s best joy
and pleasure before we know what actually is
good?&rdquo; This fashion prevails to-day, in some instances
insisted upon for sanitary reasons, but it
has lost to us many of the finest examples of quilting
that existed because where there were no
coloured patterns to relieve the white expanse, the
quilting had to be perfect. If you have a white
quilt treasure it, for competent quilters are no
longer numerous and few there are who can reproduce
it.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">How Quilts Are Made</span></h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>T IS only in comparatively recent years that
many articles of wearing apparel and house
furnishings have been manufactured outside
the home. One after another, spinning, weaving,
shoemaking, candlemaking, tailoring, knitting, and
similar tasks have been taken from the homekeeper
because the same articles can be made
better and cheaper elsewhere. The housewife still
keeps busy, but is occupied with tasks more to her
liking. Among the few home occupations that
have survived is quilting. With many serviceable
substitutes it is not really necessary for women
to make quilts now, but the strange fascination
about the work holds their interest. Quilt making
has developed and progressed during the very
period when textile arts in the home have declined
under the influence of the factory. More quilts
are being made at the present time and over a
wider area than ever before.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg&nbsp;90]</a></span>
Quilts, as known and used to-day, may be divided
into two general classes, washable and non-washable,
depending upon the materials of which they
are made. The methods for constructing each class
are the same, and are so very simple that it seems
hardly necessary to explain them.</p>

<p>The name quilt implies two or more fabrics
held together with many stitches. Webster defines
a quilt as &ldquo;Anything that is quilted, especially
as a quilted bedcover or a skirt worn by women;
any cover or garment made by putting wool, cotton,
etc., between two cloths and stitching them together.&rdquo;
The verb, to quilt, he defines as &ldquo;To
stitch or to sew together at frequent intervals in
order to confine in place the several layers of cloth
and wadding of which a garment, comforter, etc.,
may be made. To stitch or sew in lines or patterns.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The &ldquo;Encyclop&aelig;dia Britannica&rdquo; is a little more
explicit and also gives the derivation of the name,
quilt, as follows: &ldquo;Probably a coverlet for a bed
consisting of a mass of feathers, down, wool, or
other soft substances, surrounded by an outer
covering of linen, cloth, or other material.&rdquo; In
its earlier days the &ldquo;quilt&rdquo; was often made thick
and sewed as a form of mattress. The term was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg&nbsp;91]</a></span>
also given to a stitched, wadded lining for body armour.
&ldquo;The word came into English from old
French <i>cuilte</i>. This is derived from Latin <i>culcitra</i>,
a stuffed mattress or cushion. From the form <i>culcitra</i>
came old French <i>cotra</i>, or <i>coutre</i> whence <i>coutre
pointe</i>; this was corrupted into counterpoint, which
in turn was changed to counterpane. The word
&lsquo;pane&rsquo; is also from the Latin <i>pannus</i>, a piece of
cloth. Thus &lsquo;counterpane,&rsquo; a coverlet for a bed,
and &lsquo;quilt&rsquo; are by origin the same word.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Broadly speaking, from these definitions, any
article made up with an interlining may be called
a quilt. However, usage has restricted the meaning
of the word until now it is applied to a single form
of bed covering. In the United States the distinction
has been carried even farther and a quilt
is understood to be a light weight, closely stitched
bedcover. When made thicker, and consequently
warmer, it is called a &ldquo;comfort.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The three necessary parts of a quilt are the top,
the lining or back, and the interlining. The top,
which is the important feature, unless the quilting
is to be the only ornamentation, may be a single
piece of plain cloth; or it may be pieced together
from many small pieces different in size, colour,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg&nbsp;92]</a></span>
and shape, so as to form either simple or fanciful
designs. The top may also be adorned with designs
cut from fabrics of varying colours and applied
to the foundation with fancy stitches, or it
may be embroidered. The materials may be
either cotton, linen, wool, or silk. The back is
usually of plain material, which requires no description.
The interlining, if the quilting is to be close
and elaborate, must be thin. If warmth is desired
a thicker interlining is used and the lines of quilting
are spaced farther apart. The design of the
top and the quilting lend themselves very readily
to all manner of variations, and as a result there
is an almost infinite variety of quilts.</p>

<p>For convenience in making, nearly every quilt
is composed of a number of blocks of regular form
and size which, when joined together, make the
body of the quilt. Each of these blocks may have
a design complete in itself, or may be only part of
a large and complicated design covering the whole
top of the quilt.</p>

<p>There is a radical distinction between the verbs
&ldquo;to piece&rdquo; and &ldquo;to patch,&rdquo; as used in connection
with the making of quilts. In this instance the
former means to join together separate pieces of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg&nbsp;94]</a></span>
like material to make sections or blocks that are
in turn set together to form the top of the quilt.
The pieces are usually of uniform shape and size
and of contrasting colours. They are sewed together
with a running stitch, making a seam upon
the wrong side. The quilt called &ldquo;Star of the
East&rdquo; is an excellent example of a pieced quilt in
which a number of small pieced sections are united
to form a single design that embraces the entire
top of the quilt.</p>

<p>Patches are commonly associated with misfortune.
The one who needs them is unfortunate,
and the one who has to sew them on is usually an
object of sympathy, according to a wise old saw:
&ldquo;A hole may be thought to be an accident of the
day, but a patch is a sure sign of poverty.&rdquo; But
patch quilts belong to a different class than the
patches of necessity, and are the aristocrats of the
quilt family, while the pieced quilts came under
the heading of poor relations.</p>

<p>However, this term is a misnomer when applied to
some pieced quilts. Many of the &ldquo;scrap quilts,&rdquo; as
they are called in some localities, are very pretty
when made from gay pieces&mdash;carefully blended&mdash;of
the various shades of a single colour. The stars in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg&nbsp;95]</a></span>
the design called &ldquo;The Unknown Star&rdquo; are made
of a great variety of different patterns of pink calico,
yet the blending is so good that the effect is greatly
heightened by the multiplicity of shades.</p>

<p>Pieced quilts make a special appeal to women who
delight in the precise and accurate work necessary
in their construction. For those who enjoy making
pieced quilts, there is practically no limit to the variety
of designs available, some of which are as intricate
as the choicest mosaic. The bold and rather
heavy design known as &ldquo;Jacob&rsquo;s Ladder&rdquo; is a good
example of the pieced quilt. Another is the &ldquo;Feathered
Star,&rdquo; whose lightness and delicacy make it a
most charming pattern. The pieced quilt with one
large star in the centre, called by some &ldquo;The Star
of the East&rdquo; and by others &ldquo;The Star of Bethlehem,&rdquo;
is a striking example of mathematical exactness
in quilt piecing. In quilts made after this
pattern all the pieces must be exactly the same size
and all the seams must be the same width in order
to produce a perfect star.</p>

<p>The French word &ldquo;appliqu&eacute;&rdquo; is frequently used
to describe the patched or laid-on work. There
is no single word in the English language that exactly
translates &ldquo;appliqu&eacute;.&rdquo; The term &ldquo;applied
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg&nbsp;96]</a></span>
work&rdquo; comes nearest and is the common English
term. By common usage patchwork is now understood
to mean quilt making, and while used indiscriminately
for both pieced and patched quilts,
it really belongs to that type where the design is
cut from one fabric and applied upon another.
&ldquo;Sewed on&rdquo; and &ldquo;laid quilts&rdquo; are old terms given
to appliqu&eacute; or patched quilts.</p>

<p>The distinction between &ldquo;pieced&rdquo; and &ldquo;patched&rdquo;
quilts is fittingly described by Miss Bessie Daingerfield,
the Kentuckian who has written interestingly
of her experiences with mountain quilt makers.
She says: &ldquo;To every mountain woman her piece
quilts are her daily interest, but her patch quilts
are her glory. Even in these days, you women of
the low country know a piece quilt when you see
one, and doubtless you learned to sew on a &lsquo;four-patch&rsquo;
square. But have you among your treasures
a patch quilt? The piece quilt, of course, is
made of scraps, and its beauty or ugliness depends
upon the material and colours that come to hand,
the intricacy of the design, and one&rsquo;s skill in executing
it. I think much character building must
be done while hand and eye co&ouml;perate to make, for
example, a star quilt with its endless tiny points
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg&nbsp;97]</a></span>
for fitting and joining, but a patch quilt is a more
ambitious affair. For this the pattern is cut from
the whole piece and appliqu&eacute;d on unbleached cotton.
The colours used are commonly oil red, oil
green, and a certain rather violent yellow, and
sometimes indigo blue. These and these only are
considered reliable enough for a patch quilt, which
is made for the generations that come after. The
making of such a quilt is a work of oriental patience.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Appliqu&eacute; work is thought by some to be an
inferior kind of embroidery, although it is not. It
is not a lower but another kind of needlework in
which more is made of the stuff than of the stitching.
In appliqu&eacute; the craft to the needleworker is
not carried to its limit, but, on the other hand, it
calls for great skill in design. Effective it must be:
coarse it may be: vulgar it should not be: trivial
it can hardly be: mere prettiness is beyond its
scope: but it lends itself to dignity of design and
nobility of treatment.&rdquo; The foregoing quotation
is from &ldquo;Art in Needlework&rdquo; by Louis&nbsp;F.&nbsp;Day
and Mary Buckle. It is of interest because it
explains how appliqu&eacute; or &ldquo;laid-on&rdquo; needlework ranks
with other kinds.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg&nbsp;98]</a></span>
After all the different parts of a quilt top are
either pieced or decorated with applied designs,
they are joined together with narrow seams upon
the wrong side of the quilt. If a border is included
in the design it should harmonize in colour
and design with the body of the quilt. However,
in many quilts, borders seem to be &ldquo;a thing apart&rdquo;
from the remainder of the top and, apparently, have
been added as an afterthought to enlarge the top
after the blocks had been joined. In old quilts a
border frequently consisted of simple bands of
colours similar to those found in the body of the
quilt, but more often new material entirely different
in colour and quality was added when greater
size was desired. Many old quilts were three yards
or more square, generous proportions being very
essential in the old days of broad four-posters heaped
with feather beds.</p>

<p>The top being completed, the back or lining, of
the same dimensions as the top, is next made of
some light-weight material, usually white cotton.
The quilt, to quote the usual expression, is then
&ldquo;ready for the frames.&rdquo; In earlier days the quilting
frame could be found in every home, its simple
construction making this possible. In its usual
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg&nbsp;100]</a></span>
form it consists of four narrow pieces of wood, two
somewhat longer than a quilt, and two shorter,
perhaps half as long, with holes bored in the ends
of each piece. These pieces are made into an
oblong frame by fastenings of bolts or pegs, and
are commonly supported on the backs of chairs.
More pretentious frames are made with round
pieces for the sides, and with ends made to stand
upon the floor, about the height of a table, these
ends having round holes into which the side pieces
fit. Such a frame is then self-supporting and
frequently has a cogwheel attachment to keep
the sides in place and to facilitate the rolling and
unrolling of the quilt. The majority of frames are
very plain, but occasionally a diligent quilter is
encountered who has one made to suit her particular
requirements, or has received an unusually
well-built one as a gift. One old frame worthy of
mention was made of cherry with elaborate scroll
designed ends, cherry side bars, and a set of cogwheels
also made of cherry; all finished and polished
like a choice piece of furniture.</p>

<p>Each side bar or roll of the quilting frame is
tightly wound with cotton strips or has a piece of
muslin firmly fastened to its entire length, to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg&nbsp;101]</a></span>
which is sewed the edges of the lining, one side to
each bar. Then the extra length is rolled up on
one side of the frame, and after being tightly
stretched, the wooden pieces are securely fastened.
On this stretched lining or back of the quilt, the
cotton or wool used for filling or interlining is
spread very carefully and smoothly; then with even
greater care the top is put in place, its edge pinned
or basted to the edge of the lining, and drawn
tightly over the cotton. The ends of the quilt
must also be stretched. This is done by pinning
pieces of muslin to the quilt and wrapping them
around the ends of the frame. Great care is required
to keep all edges true and to stretch all
parts of the quilt uniformly.</p>

<p>Upon this smooth top the quilting is drawn, for
even the most expert quilters require outlines to
quilt by. If the quilt top is light in colour the
design is drawn with faint pencil lines; if the colours
are too dark to show pencil markings, then with
a chalked line. It is a fascinating thing to children
to watch the marking of a quilt with the chalk
lines. The firm cord used for this is drawn repeatedly
across a piece of chalk or through powdered
starch until well coated, then held near the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg&nbsp;102]</a></span>
quilt, and very tightly stretched, while a second
person draws it up and lets it fly back with a snap,
thus making a straight white line. How closely
the lines are drawn depends wholly upon the ambition
and diligence of the quilter. The lines may
be barely a quarter of an inch apart, or may be
placed only close enough together to perform their
function of keeping the interlining in place.</p>

<p>Patterns of quiltings are not as plentiful as
designs for the patchwork tops of quilts; only about
eight or ten standard patterns being in general use.
The simplest pattern consists of &ldquo;single diagonal&rdquo;
lines, spaced to suit the work in hand. The lines
are run diagonally across the quilt instead of parallel
with the weave, in order that they may show
to better advantage, and also because the cloth
is less apt to tear or pull apart than if the quilting
lines are run in the same direction as the threads of
the fabric. The elaboration of the &ldquo;single&rdquo; diagonal
into sets of two or more parallel lines, thus forming
the &ldquo;double&rdquo; and &ldquo;triple&rdquo; diagonals, is the first step
toward ornamentation in quilting. A further advance
is made when the quilting lines are crossed, by
means of which patterns like the &ldquo;square,&rdquo; &ldquo;diamond,&rdquo;
and &ldquo;hanging diamond&rdquo; are produced.</p>

Wavy lines and various arrangements of hoops,
circles, and segments of circles are among the more
complex quilting patterns, which are not particularly
difficult. Plates and saucers of various
diameters are always available to serve as markers
in laying out such designs. The &ldquo;pineapple,&rdquo;
&ldquo;broken plaid,&rdquo; and &ldquo;shell&rdquo; patterns are very
popular, especially with those who are more experienced
in the art. One very effective design
used by many quilters is known as the &ldquo;Ostrich
Feather.&rdquo; These so-called feathers are arranged
in straight bands, waved lines, or circles, and&mdash;when
the work is well done&mdash;are very beautiful.
The &ldquo;fan&rdquo; and &ldquo;twisted rope&rdquo; patterns are familiar
to the older quilters but are not much used
at the present time.</p>

<p>Frequently the quilting design follows the pieced
or patched pattern and is then very effective,
especially when a floral pattern is used. Some
quilters show much originality and ingenuity in
incorporating into their work the outlines of the
flowers and leaves of the quilt design. Sometimes
the pieced top is of such common material as to
seem an unworthy basis for the beautiful work of
an experienced quilter, who stitches with such
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg&nbsp;106]</a></span>
patient hand, wasting, some may think, her art
upon too poor a subject. However, for the consolation
of those who consider quilting a wicked
waste of time, it may be added that nowadays expert
quilters are very few indeed, and enthusiasts
who have spent weeks piecing a beautiful quilt
have been known to wait a year before being able
to get it quilted by an expert in this art.</p>

<p>On the thin cotton quilts that have the elaborate
quilting designs and are the pride of the owner,
the quilting is done with fine cotton thread, about
number seventy. The running stitch used in
quilting should be as small and even as it is possible
for the quilter to make. This is a very difficult
feat to accomplish, since the quilt composed of two
thicknesses of cloth with an interlining of cotton
is stretched so tightly in the frame that it is quite
difficult to push the needle through. Also the
quilter, while bending over the frame with one
hand above and one hand below, is in a somewhat
unnatural strained position. It requires much
patience to acquire the knack of sitting in the
rather uncomfortable quilter&rsquo;s position without
quickly tiring.</p>

<p>Skill and speed in quilting can be acquired only
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg&nbsp;107]</a></span>
through much practice. Perfect quilting cannot
be turned out by a novice in the art, no matter
how skilful she may be at other kinds of needlework.
The patience and skill of the quilter are
especially taxed when, in following the vagaries
of some design, she is forced to quilt lines that
extend away from her instead of toward her. As
the result of many years spent over the quilting
frame, some quilters acquire an unusual dexterity
in handling the needle, and occasionally one is
encountered who can quilt as well with one hand as
with the other.</p>

<p class="caption">PUFFED QUILT OF SILK</p>

<p class="incaption" style="padding-bottom: 3em;">This is a very popular pieced quilt, composed of carefully saved bits of
silks and velvets</p>

<p>Quilting is usually paid for by the amount of
thread used, no consideration being given to the
amount of time expended on the work. A spool
of cotton thread, such as is found in every dry-goods
store, averaging two hundred yards to the
spool, is the universal measure. The price charged
is more a matter of locality than excellence of
workmanship. A certain price will prevail in one
section among all quilters there, while in another,
not far removed, two or three times that price
will be asked for the same work. When many of
the old quilts, now treasured as remembrances of
our diligent and ambitious ancestors, were made,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg&nbsp;109]</a></span>
one dollar per spool was the usual price paid for
quilting. However, as the number of quilters
has decreased, the price of quilting has increased,
until as much as five dollars per spool is now asked
in some parts of the country. Even at the advanced
prices, it is exceedingly difficult to find sufficient
quilters to complete the many pieced and
appliqu&eacute; quilts being made.</p>

<p>After the space of some twelve inches, which is
as far as the quilter can reach conveniently, has
been quilted, the completed portion is rolled up on
the side of the frame nearest the quilter. From
the other side another section is then unrolled and
marked for quilting, and quilted as far as the
worker can reach. Thus quilting and rolling are
continued until the whole quilt is gone over, after
which it is taken from the frame and the edges
neatly bound with a narrow piece of bias material,
either white or of some harmonizing colour. Since
all of the stitches are taken entirely through the
quilt, the design worked into the top is repeated
on the lining, so that the back makes a white
spread of effective pattern in low relief. Very
often the back or reverse side is as beautiful as
the top, and many lovely quilts have ended their
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg&nbsp;110]</a></span>
years of service as white counterpanes during that
period when the vogue for white beds reigned.
Now, however, owners are glad to display them
in all their gorgeousness, and they no longer masquerade
as white bedspreads.</p>

<p>Occasionally the date of making and the initials
of the maker are quilted in a corner, but it is seldom
that even this much is visible to tell of the
quilt&rsquo;s origin. How interesting it would be if some
bits of the story of the maker could have been sewed
into a few of the old quilts; for such works of art,
that are so long in making, deserve to have some
facts relating to them live at least as long as they.</p>

<p>When a bedcover of exceptional warmth is desired,
several sheets of cotton or wool prepared for
that purpose are laid one over the other between
the top and back. As this is too thick to allow a
needle to be pushed through easily, and even
stitches cannot be taken, then quilting gives way
to tying or knotting. Threads of silk, cotton,
linen, or wool are drawn through with coarse needles
and the ends tied in tight, firm knots. These knots
are arranged at close, regular intervals to prevent
the interlining from slipping out of place. To
this kind of covering is applied the very
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg&nbsp;111]</a></span>
appropriate name of &ldquo;comfort.&rdquo; Holland, Germany,
Switzerland, and all of Scandinavia use quilted
down and feather comforts. In fact, the down
comfort has become international in its use. It is
found in almost every home in the colder regions
of Europe and America, and on chilly nights is a
comfort indeed. They are usually made in one
colour and, aside from the quilting, which is in
bold, artistic designs, are without other decoration.
The quilting on down comforts is done by machines
made expressly for that work.</p>

<p>Quilting is not confined to the making of quilts.
The petticoats worn by the women of Holland are
substantial affairs made of either woollen cloth or
satin, as the purse permits, heavily interlined and
elaborately quilted. The Dutch belle requires
from four to nine of these skirts to give her the
figure typical of her country. Both the Chinese
and Japanese make frequent use of quilting in
their thickly padded coats and kimonos, and it
may be that from them the early Dutch voyagers
and traders brought back the custom to Holland.</p>

<p>A knowledge of the simplest form of sewing is
all that is necessary to piece quilts. The running
stitch used for narrow seams is the first stitch a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg&nbsp;113]</a></span>
beginner learns. There are other stitches needed
to make a patchwork quilt, which frequently develops
into quite an elaborate bit of needlework.
The applied designs should always be neatly hemmed
to the foundation; some, however, are embroidered
and the edges of the designs finished with a buttonhole
stitch, and other fancy stitches may be introduced.</p>

<p>In quilt making, as in every other branch of
needlework, much experience is required to do
good work. It takes much time and practice to
acquire accuracy in cutting and arranging all the
different pieces. A discriminating eye for harmonizing
colours is also a great advantage. But
above all requirements the quilt maker must be
an expert needleworker, capable of making the
multitude of tiny stitches with neatness and precision
if she would produce the perfect quilt.</p>

<p>Appreciation of nature is an attribute of many
quilt makers, as shown by their efforts to copy various
forms of leaf and flower. There are many
conventionalized floral patterns on appliqu&eacute; quilts
that give evidence of much ability and originality
in their construction. For the pioneer woman
there was no convenient school of design, and when
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg&nbsp;114]</a></span>
she tired of the oft-repeated quilt patterns of her
neighbourhood she turned to her garden for suggestions.
The striking silhouettes of familiar blossoms
seen on many quilts are the direct result of
her nature study.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Quilt Names</span></h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>MONG the most fascinating features of quilt
lore are the great number and wonderful
variety of names given to quilt designs.
A distinct individuality is worked into every
quilt by its maker, which in most instances makes
it worthy of a name. The many days spent in
creating even a simple quilt give the maker ample
time in which to ponder over a name for the design,
so that the one selected generally reflects some peculiarity
in her personality. History, politics, religion,
nature, poetry, and romance, all are stitched
into the gayly coloured blocks and exert their
influence on quilt appellations. Careful consideration
of a large number of quilts reveals but few
that have been named in a haphazard way; in
nearly every instance there was a reason or at
least a suggestion for the name.</p>

<p>In most cases the relation between name and
design is so evident that the correct name at once
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg&nbsp;116]</a></span>
suggests itself, even to the novice in quilt making.
The common &ldquo;star&rdquo; pattern, in which one star is
made the centre of each block, is invariably known
as the &ldquo;Five-pointed Star.&rdquo; A variation in the size
of the stars or the number of colours entering into
their composition has not resulted in any new name.</p>

<p>It is quite usual, however, when there is a slight
deviation from a familiar pattern, resulting from
either the introduction of some variation or by the
omission of a portion of the old design, to make a
corresponding change in the name. Good illustrations
of this custom are the minor alterations
which have been made in the tree trunk of the
&ldquo;tree&rdquo; pattern. These may be so slight as to be
entirely unobserved by the casual admirer, yet
they are responsible for at least three new names:
&ldquo;Pine Tree,&rdquo; &ldquo;Temperance Tree,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Tree of
Paradise.&rdquo; A minor change in the ordinary &ldquo;Nine
Patch,&rdquo; with a new name as a result, is another
striking example of how very slight an alteration
may be in order to inspire a new title. In this
case, the central block is cut somewhat larger than
in the old &ldquo;Nine Patch,&rdquo; and the four corner blocks
are, by comparison with the centre block, quite
small. This slight change is in reality a magical
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg&nbsp;117]</a></span>
transformation, for the staid &ldquo;Nine Patch&rdquo; has
now become a lively &ldquo;Puss-in-the-Corner.&rdquo; The
changes in some patterns have come about through
efforts to make a limited amount of highly prized
colour brighten a whole quilt. This circumstance, as
much as any other, has been the cause of new names.</p>

<p>Important events occurring during the construction
periods of old quilts are quite frequently
recalled to us by their names. The stirring frontier
activities and the great men of history made impressions
on the mind of the housewife which
found expression in the names of her quilts.
&ldquo;Washington&rsquo;s Plumes,&rdquo; &ldquo;Mexican Rose,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Rose of Dixie&rdquo; are old quilt names reflecting
domestic interest in important events. The hardships
and vicissitudes endured by the sturdy pioneers
were constantly in the minds of the early
American quilters and inspired many names.
&ldquo;Pilgrim&rsquo;s Pride,&rdquo; &ldquo;Bear&rsquo;s Paws,&rdquo; &ldquo;Rocky Road
to Kansas,&rdquo; &ldquo;Texas Tears,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Rocky Road to
California&rdquo; have great interest as they reveal to
us the thoughts of our great-grandmothers over
their quilting frames.</p>

<p>The names having political significance, which
were attached to quilts, show that the women as
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg&nbsp;118]</a></span>
well as the men had a keen interest in the affairs
of our country in its earlier days. &ldquo;Old Tippecanoe,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Lincoln&rsquo;s Platform,&rdquo; &ldquo;Harrison Rose,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Democrat Rose,&rdquo; &ldquo;Whig Rose,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Radical
Rose&rdquo; are all suggestive of the great discussion
over slavery. Of the last name, an old lady, famous
for her quilt making, said: &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s my &lsquo;Radical
Rose.&rsquo; I reckon you&rsquo;ve heard I was the first human
that ever put black in a Radical Rose. Thar hit
is, right plumb in the middle. Well, whenever
you see black in a Radical Rose you can know hit
war made atter the second year of the war (Civil
War). Hit was this way, ever&rsquo; man war a-talkin&rsquo;
about the Radicals and all the women tuk to makin&rsquo;
Radical Roses. One day I got to studying that
thar ought to be some black in that thar pattern,
sence half the trouble was to free the niggers, and hit
didn&rsquo;t look fair to leave them out. And from that
day to this thar&rsquo;s been black in ever&rsquo; Radical Rose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Other names having patriotic, political, or historical
significance are:</p>

<p class="list">

There is also the &ldquo;Centennial&rdquo; in commemoration
of the Centennial Exposition held at Philadelphia
in 1876, and &ldquo;The World&rsquo;s Fair,&rdquo; &ldquo;World&rsquo;s Fair
Puzzle,&rdquo; and &ldquo;World&rsquo;s Fair Blocks&rdquo; to perpetuate
the grandeurs of the great exposition held at Chicago
in 1893.</p>

<p>Religion is closely associated with the life of the
industrious, sober-minded dwellers of our villages
and farms, and it is the most natural thing in the
world for the Biblical teachings to crop out in the
names of their quilts, as the following names indicate:</p>

Joseph&rsquo;s Coat<br />
Solomon&rsquo;s Temple<br />

<p>The glories of the sky enjoy ample prominence
among quilt names. Beginning with the &ldquo;Rising
Sun,&rdquo; of which there are several different designs,

<p>In connection with the &ldquo;Star&rdquo; quilt names it is
worthy of notice that geometric names outnumber

<p>Names of a nautical turn are to be expected for
quilts which originate in seaside cottages and
seaport villages. &ldquo;Bounding Betty,&rdquo; &ldquo;Ocean
Waves,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Storm at Sea&rdquo; have a flavour as
salty as the spray which dampens them when they
are spread out to sun by the sandy shore.</p>

<p>That poetry and romance have left their mark
on the quilt is shown by the names that have been
drawn from these sources. &ldquo;Lady of the Lake,&rdquo;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg&nbsp;122]</a></span>
&ldquo;Charm,&rdquo; &ldquo;Air Castle,&rdquo; &ldquo;Wheel of Fortune,&rdquo;
and &ldquo;Wonder of the World&rdquo; are typical examples.
Sentimental names are also in evidence, as &ldquo;Love
Rose,&rdquo; &ldquo;Lovers&rsquo; Links,&rdquo; &ldquo;True Lovers&rsquo; Knot,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Friendship Quilt,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Wedding Knot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nature furnishes more suggestions for beautiful
quilt designs than any other source. So frequently
are her models resorted to by quilt makers the
world over that many different designs have been
inspired by the same leaf or flower. The rose
especially is used again and again, and will always
be the favourite flower of the quilter. There are
at least twenty &ldquo;rose&rdquo; names to prove how this
flower has endeared itself to the devotees of piece-block
and quilting frame:</p>

<p>When seeking flowers that lend themselves
readily to quilt designs it is best to choose those
whose leaves and blossoms present clear, distinct,
and easily traced outlines. The names of many
of the quaint varieties that flourish in old-fashioned
gardens, as lilacs, phlox, larkspur, and marigolds,
are absent from the list. This is because their
lacy foliage and complex arrangement of petals
cannot be reproduced satisfactorily in quilt materials.</p>

<p>Even the lowly vegetables secure some mention
among quilt names with &ldquo;Corn and Beans.&rdquo; The

Sometimes the names of a flower and a locality are
combined, as in &ldquo;Persian Palm Lily&rdquo; and &ldquo;Carolina
Lily.&rdquo; This latter design is quite a popular
one in the Middle West, where it is known also as
&ldquo;Star Flower.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Figures and letters come in for some attention,

<p>Occasionally the wag of the family had his opportunity,
for it took some one with a strain of dry
humour to suggest &ldquo;Old Bachelor&rsquo;s Puzzle,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Drunkard&rsquo;s Path,&rdquo; and &ldquo;All Tangled Up,&rdquo; or
to have ironically called one quilt a &ldquo;Blind Man&rsquo;s
Fancy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Imagination was not lacking when it came to
applying apt names to some of the simplest designs.
To have called rows of small triangles running
diagonally across a quilt the &ldquo;Wild Goose Chase,&rdquo;
the maker must have known something of the
habits of wild geese, for as these migrate from
North to South and back again following the summer&rsquo;s
warmth, they fly one behind the other in
long V-shaped lines. The resemblance of these
lines, swiftly moving across the sky, to her neat
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg&nbsp;129]</a></span>
rows of triangles supplied the quilt maker with her

descriptive that their mention is sure to provoke
a grin, occur with pleasing frequency. Who can

<p>In the old days grown-up folks were not the
only ones who had to do with naming the quilts;
children shared in the honour, and many of the
quaint and fantastic names were the result of
humouring their fancies. There was no &ldquo;B&rsquo;rer
Rabbit&rdquo; in quilt lore, but he was not missed when
the two or three youngsters who cuddled in the
old-fashioned trundle bed could have so many
other fascinating names for their quilts. &ldquo;Four
Little Birds,&rdquo; &ldquo;Ducks and Ducklings,&rdquo; &ldquo;Children&rsquo;s
Delight,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Little Red House,&rdquo; &ldquo;Goose in the
Pond,&rdquo; &ldquo;The House That Jack Built,&rdquo; &ldquo;Toad in the
Puddle,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Johnny Around the Corner&rdquo; are some
of the old names still in use to-day. Any one of these
patterns made up into a quilt was a treasure to imaginative
children, and it was doubly so when they
could pick out among the tiny blocks bits of colour
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg&nbsp;131]</a></span>
that were once in their own gay dresses and pinafores.</p>

<p>Clinging lavender wisteria, sweet jasmine, and
even scarlet amaryllis pale beside the glowing
colours displayed during sunny spring days on the
gallery rails of many country homes through Delaware
and Virginia. These picturesque scenes, in
which the familiar domestic art supplies the essential
touch of colour, are aptly described by
Robert and Elizabeth Shackleton, those indefatigable
searchers for the beautiful among the relics of
our forefathers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In many a little village, and in many an isolated
mountain home, the old-time art of making patchwork
coverlets is remembered and practised. Some
may be found that are generations old; others are
new, but made in precisely the old-time way, and
after the same patterns. Many are in gorgeous
colours, in glowing yellows, greens, and purples;
and being a matter of housewifely pride, they are
often thrown over the &lsquo;gallery rail&rsquo; so their glory
may be seen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One guest bed had nineteen quilts! Not to
sleep under such a padded mountain, but it was
the most natural method of display. Each quilt
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg&nbsp;132]</a></span>
had its name. There was the &ldquo;Western Star,&rdquo;
the &ldquo;Rose of the Carolinas,&rdquo; the &ldquo;Log Cabin,&rdquo;
the &ldquo;Virginia Gentleman,&rdquo; the &ldquo;Fruit Basket,&rdquo;
the &ldquo;Lily of the Valley&rdquo;&mdash;as many special names
as there are designs.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Quilt Collections and Exhibitions</span></h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>N SPITE of their wide distribution and vast
quantity, the number of quilts readily accessible
to those who are interested in them
is exceedingly small. This is particularly true
of those quilts which possess artistic merit and
historic interest, and a considerable amount of
inquiry is sometimes necessary in order to bring
forth even a single quilt of more than ordinary
beauty. It is unfortunate for this most useful and
pleasant art that its masterpieces are so shy and
loath to display their charms, for it is mainly from
the rivalry induced by constant display that all
arts secure their best stimulus. However, some
very remarkable achievements in quilting have
been brought to light from time to time, to the
great benefit of this best of household arts.</p>

<p>There is in existence to-day no complete collection
of quilts readily available to the public at
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg&nbsp;134]</a></span>
large. No museum in this country or abroad has
a collection worthy of the name, the nearest approach
to it being in the great South Kensington
Museum in London. While many institutions possess
one or more specimens, these have been preserved
more often on account of some historic association
than because of exceptional beauty or artistic
merit. It is only in the rare instance of a family
collection, resulting from the slow accumulation
by more than one generation of quilt enthusiasts,
that a quilt collection at all worth while can be
found. In such a case the owner is generally so
reticent concerning his treasures that the community
as a whole is never given the opportunity to
profit by them.</p>

<p>In families where accumulations have reached
the dignity in numbers that will justify being
called collections, the quilts belonging to different
branches of the family have been passed along from
one generation to another, until they have become
the property of one person. Among collections of
this sort are found many rare and beautiful quilts,
as only the best and choicest of all that were made
have been preserved. There are also occasional
large collections of quilts that are the work of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg&nbsp;135]</a></span>
one industrious maker who has spent the greater
portion of her life piecing and quilting. The Kentucky
mountain woman who had &ldquo;eighty-three,
all different, and all her own makin&rsquo;,&rdquo; is a typical
example of this class.</p>

<p class="incaption" style="padding-bottom: 3em;">Seems to bring a breath of springtime both in form and colour. Even the
border flowers seem to be waving and nodding in the breeze</p>

<p>The vastness of their numbers and the great
extent of their everyday use serve to check the
collecting of quilts. As a whole, quilts are extremely
heterogeneous and democratic; they are
made so generally over the whole country that no
distinct types have been developed, and they are
possessed so universally that there is little social
prestige to be gained by owning an uncommonly
large number. Consequently even the most ardent
quilt lovers are usually satisfied when they possess
enough for their own domestic needs, with perhaps
a few extra for display in the guest chambers.</p>

<p>Much of the social pleasure of the pioneer women
was due to their widespread interest in quilts.
Aside from the quilting bees, which were notable
affairs, collecting quilt patterns was to many women
a source of both interest and enjoyment.
Even the most ambitious woman could not hope
to make a quilt like every design which she admired,
so, to appease the desire for the numerous ones she
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg&nbsp;136]</a></span>
was unable to make, their patterns were collected.
These collections of quilt patterns&mdash;often quite
extensive, frequently included single blocks of
both pieced and patched designs. There was always
a neighbourly and friendly interest taken in
such collections, as popular designs were exchanged
and copied many times. Choice remnants of prints
and calicoes were also shared with the neighbours.
Occasionally from trunks or boxes, long hidden in
dusty attics, some of these old blocks come to light,
yellowed with age and frayed at the edges, to remind
us of the simple pleasures of our grandmothers.</p>

<p>At the present time there is a marked revival
of interest in quilts and their making. The evidences
of this revival are the increasing demand for
competent quilters, the desire for new quilt patterns,
and the growing popularity of quilt exhibitions.
Concerning exhibits of quilts, there
is apparent&mdash;at least in the northern part of the
United States&mdash;a noticeable increase in popular
appreciation of those held at county and state fairs.
This is a particularly fortunate circumstance for
the development of the art, because the county
fair, &ldquo;our one steadfast institution in a world of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg&nbsp;137]</a></span>
change,&rdquo; is so intimately connected with the lives
and is so dear to the hearts of our people.</p>

<p>In addition to the pleasures and social diversions
which that annual rural festival&mdash;the county fair&mdash;affords,
it is an educational force that is not sufficiently
appreciated by those who live beyond the
reach of its spell. At best, country life contains
long stretches of monotony, and any interest with
which it can be relieved is a most welcome addition
to the lives of the women in rural communities.
At the fair women are touched to new thoughts
on common themes. They come to meet each
other and talk over the latest kinks in jelly making,
the progress of their children, and similar details
of their family affairs. They come to get standards
of living and to gather ideas of home decoration
and entertainment for the long evenings when intercourse,
even with the neighbours, becomes infrequent.</p>

<p>There is not the least doubt concerning the beneficial
influence of the local annual fair on the life of
the adjacent neighbourhood. At such a fair the
presence of a varied and well-arranged display of
needlework, which has been produced by the womenfolk,
is of the greatest assistance in making
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg&nbsp;138]</a></span>
the community one in which it is worth while to
live. Not only does it serve as a stimulus to those
who look forward to the fair and put into their art
the very best of their ability in order that they may
surpass their competitor next door, but it also
serves as an inspiration to those who are denied
the faculty of creating original designs, yet nevertheless
take keen pleasure in the production of
beautiful needlework. It is to this latter class
that an exhibition of quilts is of real value, because
it provides them with new patterns that can be
applied to the quilts which must be made. With
fresh ideas for their inspiration, work which would
otherwise be tedious becomes a real pleasure.</p>

<p>For the women of the farm the exhibit of domestic
arts and products occupies the pre&euml;minent
place at the county fair. In this exhibit the display
of patchwork is sure to arouse the liveliest
enthusiasm. A visitor at a fair in a western state
very neatly describes this appreciation shown to
quilts: &ldquo;We used to hear a great deal about the
sad and lonely fate of the western farmer&rsquo;s wife, but
there was little evidence of loneliness in the appearance
of these women who surrounded the quilts
and fancywork in the Domestic Arts Building.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg&nbsp;139]</a></span>
In connection with the display of needlework at
rural fairs, it is interesting to note how ancient is
this custom. In the &ldquo;Social History of Ancient
Ireland&rdquo; is the following description of an Irish
fair held during the fourth century&mdash;long before
the advent of St. Patrick and Christianity: &ldquo;The
people of Leinster every three years during the
first week of August held the &lsquo;Fair of Carman.&rsquo;
Great ceremony and formality attended this event,
the King of Leinster and his court officiating.
Music formed a prominent part of the amusement.
One day was set apart for recitation of poems and
romantic tales, another for horse and chariot racing.
In another part of the Fair people indulged in uproarious
fun, crowded around showmen, jugglers,
clowns with painted faces or hideously grotesqued
masks. Prizes publicly presented by King or
dignitary were given to winners of various contests.
Needlework was represented by &lsquo;the slope
of the embroidering women,&rsquo; where women actually
did their work in the presence of spectators.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A very important factor in the recent revival of
interest in quilts has been the springing up of impromptu
exhibits as &ldquo;benefits&rdquo; for worthy causes,
the raising of funds for which is a matter of popular
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg&nbsp;140]</a></span>
interest. Does a church need a new roof, a hospital
some more furnishings, or a college a new
building? And have all the usual methods of
raising money become hackneyed and uninspiring
to those interested in furthering the project? To
those confronted with such a money-raising problem
the quilt exhibition offers a most welcome
solution. For not only does such an exhibition
offer a new form of entertainment, but it also has
sources of interesting material from which to draw
that are far richer than commonly supposed.</p>

<p>Not so very long ago &ldquo;The Country Contributor&rdquo;
undertook the task of giving a quilt show, and
her description of it is distinctly worth while:</p>

<p>&ldquo;My ideas were a bit vague. I had a mental
picture of some beautiful quilts I knew of hung
against a wall somewhere for people to come and
look at and wonder over. So we announced the
quilt show and then went on our way rejoicing.
A good-natured school board allowed us to have
the auditorium at the high school building for the
display and the quilt agitation began.</p>

<p class="caption">AS GOLDEN BUTTERFLIES AND PANSIES</p>

<p class="incaption" style="padding-bottom: 3em;">Are so often playmates of little ones in the garden, and beloved by them,
they were chosen for the motifs of this child&rsquo;s quilt</p>

<p>&ldquo;A day or two before the show, which was to be
on a Saturday, it began to dawn upon me that I
might be buried under an avalanche of quilts.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg&nbsp;141]</a></span>
The old ones were terribly large. They were
made to cover a fat feather bed or two and to hang
down to hide the trundle bed underneath, and,
though the interlining of cotton was very thin and
even, still the weight of a quilt made by one&rsquo;s
grandmother is considerable.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We betook ourselves to the school building at
an early hour on Saturday morning and the fun
began. We were to receive entries until one
o&rsquo;clock, when the exhibition was to begin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In looking back now at this little event, I
wonder we could have been so benighted as to
imagine we could do it in a day! After about an
hour, during which the quilts came in by the dozen,
I sent in a general alarm to friends and kindred
for help. We engaged a carpenter, strung up
wires and ropes, and by some magic of desperation
we got those quilts on display, 118 of them, by
one o&rsquo;clock.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One lovely feature of this quilt show was the
reverence with which men brought to us the quilts
their mothers made. Plain farmers, busy workers,
retired business men, came to us, their faces
softened to tenderness, handed us, with mingled
pride and devotion, their big bundle containing a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg&nbsp;142]</a></span>
contribution to the display, saying in softened
accents, &lsquo;My mother made it.&rsquo; And each and
every quilt brought thus was worthy of a price on
its real merit&mdash;not for its hallowed association
alone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Time and space would fail if I should try to tell
about the quilts that came in at our call for an exhibition.
There were so many prize quilts (fully
two thirds of the quilts entered deserved prizes)
that it is difficult to say what finally decided the
blue ribbon. However, the quilt which finally carried
it away was fairly typical of those of the early
part of the nineteenth century. A rose pattern
was applied in coloured calicoes on each alternate
block. The geometrical calculation, the miraculous
neatness of this work, can scarcely be exaggerated.
But this is not the wonder of the thing.
The real wonder is the quilting. This consisted
in copying the design, petal for petal, leaf for leaf,
in needlework upon every alternate block of white
muslin. How these workers accomplished the
raised designs on plain white muslin is the mystery.
How raised flowers, leaves, plumes, baskets,
bunches of fruit, even animal and bird shapes,
could be shown in bas-relief on these quilt blocks
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg&nbsp;143]</a></span>
without hopelessly &lsquo;puckering&rsquo; the material, none
of us can imagine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>No other inspiration that can equal our fairs has
been offered to the quilters of our day. Public
recognition of good work and the premiums which
accompany this recognition augment the desire
to excel in the art of quilt making. The keen
competition engendered results in the most exact
and painstaking work possible being put upon
quilts that are entered for the &ldquo;blue ribbon.&rdquo; The
materials, designs, and colours chosen for these
quilts are given the most careful consideration,
and the stitchery is as nearly perfect as it is possible
to make it.</p>

<p>Some of the finest old quilts that have been preserved
are repeatedly exhibited at county and state
fairs, and have more than held their own with those
made in recent years. One shown at an exhibition
of quilts and coverlets, held in a city in southern
Indiana in 1914, had been awarded the first premium
at thirty-seven different fairs. This renowned
and venerable quilt had been made more
than seventy-five years before. Its design is the
familiar one known as the &ldquo;Rose of Sharon&rdquo;;
both the needlework on the design and the quilting
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg&nbsp;144]</a></span>
are exquisite, the stitches being all but invisible.</p>

<p>A striking instance of the influence of fairs upon
quilt making is shown in the number of beautiful
quilts that have been made expressly for display in
exhibitions at state fairs in the Middle West. One
such collection, worthy of special notice, consists of
seven quilts: three of elaborate designs in patchwork
and four made up of infinitesimal pieces.
Every stitch, both on the handsome tops and in
the perfect quilting, was wrought with careful patience
by an old-time quilt maker. The aggregate
amount of stitching upon these seven quilts seems
enough to constitute the work of a lifetime. The
material in these quilts, except one which is of silk,
is fine white muslin and the reliable coloured calicoes
of fifty years ago.</p>

<p>This extraordinary and beautiful collection is
now being carefully preserved by an appreciative
daughter, who tells how it was possible for her
mother to accomplish this great task of needlework.
The maker was the wife of a busy and prosperous
farmer of northern Indiana. As on all
farms in that region during the pioneer days, the
home was the centre of manufacture of those
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg&nbsp;145]</a></span>
various articles necessary to the welfare and comfort
of the family. This indulgent farmer, realizing
that his wife&rsquo;s quilt making was work of a higher
plane than routine housekeeping, employed two
stout daughters of a less fortunate neighbour to
relieve her of the heavier household duties. Such
work that required her direct supervision, as jelly
making and fruit canning, was done in the evenings.
This allowed the ambitious little woman
ample time to pursue her art during the bright
clear hours of daylight.</p>

<p>Belonging to the collections of individuals are
many old quilts which possess more than ordinary
interest, not so much on account of their beauty
or unusual patterns, but because of their connection
with some notable personage or historic event.
The number of quilts which are never used, but
which are most carefully treasured by their owners
on account of some sentimental or historic association,
is far greater than generally supposed.
While most of the old quilts so jealously hidden
in closet and linen chest have no extraordinary
beauty, yet from time to time there comes into
notice one which possesses&mdash;in addition to its
interesting connection with the past&mdash;an exquisite
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg&nbsp;146]</a></span>
and mellow beauty which only tasteful design enhanced
by age can give.</p>

<p>Quite often beautiful quilts are found in old
trunks and bureaus, which have gathered dust for
untold years in attics and storerooms. Opportunities
to ransack old garrets are greatly appreciated
by collectors, as the uncertainty of what
may be found gives zest to their search. It was of
such old treasure trove that the hangings were
found to make what Harriet Beecher Stowe in her
novel, &ldquo;The Minister&rsquo;s Wooing,&rdquo; calls &ldquo;the garret
boudoir.&rdquo; This was a cozy little enclosure made
by hanging up old quilts, blankets, and coverlets
so as to close off one corner of the garret. Her
description of an old quilt used in this connection
is especially interesting. It &ldquo;was a bed quilt
pieced in tiny blocks, none of them bigger than a
sixpence, containing, as Mrs. Katy said, pieces of
the gowns of all her grandmothers, aunts, cousins,
and female relatives for years back; and mated
to it was one of the blankets which had served
Mrs. Scudder&rsquo;s uncle in his bivouac at Valley
Forge.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To view the real impromptu exhibitions of
quilts&mdash;for which, by the way, no admission fee is
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg&nbsp;147]</a></span>
charged&mdash;one should drive along any country
road on a bright sunny day in early spring. It is
at this time that the household bedding is given its
annual airing, and consequently long lines hung
with quilts are frequent and interesting sights.
During this periodical airing there becomes apparent
a seemingly close alliance between patchwork
and nature, as upon the soft green background of
new leaves the beauty of the quilts is thrown into
greater prominence. All the colours of the rainbow
can be seen in the many varieties of design,
for there is not a line that does not bear a startling
&ldquo;Lone Star of Texas,&rdquo; &ldquo;Rising Sun,&rdquo; or some
equally attractive pattern. Gentle breezes stir
the quilts so that their designs and colours gain in
beauty as they slowly wave to and fro. When
the apple, cherry, and peach trees put on their
new spring dresses of delicate blossoms and stand
in graceful groups in the background, then the
picture becomes even more charming.</p>

<p>This periodical airing spreads from neighbour
to neighbour, and as one sunny day follows another
all the clothes lines become weighted with burdens
of brightest hues. Of course, there is no rivalry
between owners, or no unworthy desire to show off,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg&nbsp;148]</a></span>
yet, have you ever seen a line full of quilts hung
wrong side out? It has been suggested that at an
exhibition is the logical place to see quilts bloom.
Yet, while it is a rare chance to see quilts of all
kinds and in all states of preservation, yet it is
much like massing our wild Sweet Williams, Spring
Beauties, and Violets in a crowded greenhouse.
They bravely do their best, but you can fairly see
them gasping for the fresh, free air of their woodland
homes. A quilt hung on a clothes line in the
dooryard and idly flapping in the wind receives
twice the appreciation given one which is sedately
folded across a wire with many others in a crowded,
jealous row.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Quilt&rsquo;s Place in American Homes</span></h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE dominant characteristics of quilt making
are companionship and concentrated
interest. Both of these qualities, or&mdash;better
yet&mdash;virtues, must be in evidence in order
to bring a quilt to successful completion. The
sociable, gossipy &ldquo;quilting bee,&rdquo; where the quilt
is put together and quilted, has planted in every
community in which it is an institution the seeds
of numberless lifelong friendships. These friendships
are being made over the quilting frames to-day
just as they were in the pioneer times when a
&ldquo;quilting&rdquo; was almost the only social diversion.
Content with life, fixity of purpose, development of
individuality, all are brought forth in every woman
who plans and pieces a quilt. The reward of her
work lies, not only in the pleasure of doing, but also
in the joy of possession&mdash;which can be passed on
even to future generations, for a well-made quilt
is a lasting treasure.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg&nbsp;150]</a></span>
All this is quite apart from the strictly useful
functions which quilts perform so creditably in every
home, for quilts are useful as well as artistic. In
summer nights they are the ideal emergency covering
for the cool hour before dawn, or after a rapid
drop in temperature, caused by a passing thunderstorm.
But in the long chill nights of winter, when
the snow sifts in through the partly raised window
and all mankind snuggles deeper into the bed
clothes, then all quilts may be truly said to do their
duty. And right well they do it, too, as all those
who love to linger within their cozy shelter on
frosty December mornings will testify.</p>

<p class="incaption" style="padding-bottom: 3em;">Offers another choice in flower designs. The full-grown blossoms on the
green background remind us of the beauty of trees
and flowers in early spring</p>

<p>As a promoter of good-will and neighbourly interest
during the times when our new country was
being settled, and woman&rsquo;s social intercourse was
very limited, the &ldquo;quilting bee&rdquo; holds a worthy
place close beside the meeting-house. The feeling
of co&ouml;peration so noticeable in all men and growing
communities, and which is really essential for their
success, is aptly described in the old &ldquo;Annals of
Tennessee,&rdquo; published by Dr. J.&nbsp;G.&nbsp;M. Ramsey in
1853 (&ldquo;Dedicated to the surviving pioneers of
Tennessee&rdquo;):</p>

<p>&ldquo;To say of one he has no neighbours was sufficient,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg&nbsp;151]</a></span>
in those times of mutual wants and mutual
benefactions, to make the churl infamous and execrable.
A failure to ask a neighbour to a raising,
clearing, a chopping frolic, or his family to a quilting,
was considered a high indignity; such an one,
too, as required to be explained or atoned for at
the next muster or county court. Each settler
was not only willing but desirous to contribute his
share to the general comfort and public improvement,
and felt aggrieved and insulted if the opportunity
to do so were withheld. &lsquo;It is a poor dog
that is not worth whistling for,&rsquo; replied the
indignant neighbour who was allowed to remain at
home, at his own work, while a house raising was
going on in the neighbourhood. &lsquo;What injury
have I done that I am slighted so?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Quilts occupied a pre&euml;minent place in the rural
social scheme, and the quilting bees were one of
the few social diversions afforded outside of the
church. Much drudgery was lightened by the
joyful anticipation of a neighbourhood quilting
bee. The preparations for such an important event
were often quite elaborate. As a form of entertainment
quilting bees have stood the test of time,
and from colonial days down to the present
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg&nbsp;152]</a></span>
have furnished much pleasure in country communities.</p>

<p>In a quaint little book published in 1872 by
Mrs. P.&nbsp;G. Gibbons, under the title, &ldquo;Pennsylvania
Dutch,&rdquo; is a detailed description of a country
quilting that Mrs. Gibbons attended. The
exact date of this social affair is not given, but
judging from other closely related incidents mentioned
by the writer, it must have taken place about
1840, in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania. The
account reads as follows:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aunt Sally had her quilt up in her landlord&rsquo;s
east room, for her own was too small. However, at
about eleven she called us over to dinner, for people
who have breakfasted at five or six have an
appetite at eleven.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We found on the table beefsteaks, boiled pork,
sweet potatoes, &lsquo;Kohl-slaw,&rsquo; pickled cucumbers and
red beets, apple butter and preserved peaches,
pumpkin and apple pie, sponge cake and coffee.
After dinner came our next neighbours, &lsquo;the maids,&rsquo;
Susy and Katy Groff, who live in single blessedness
and great neatness. They wore pretty, clear-starched
Mennonist caps, very plain. Katy is a
sweet-looking woman and, although she is more than
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg&nbsp;153]</a></span>
sixty years old, her forehead is almost unwrinkled,
and her fine hair is still brown. It was late when
the farmer&rsquo;s wife came&mdash;three o&rsquo;clock; for she had
been to Lancaster. She wore hoops and was of the
&lsquo;world&rsquo;s people.&rsquo; These women all spoke &lsquo;Dutch,&rsquo;
for the maids, whose ancestors came here probably
one hundred and fifty years ago, do not speak English
with fluency yet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The first subject of conversation was the fall
house-cleaning; and I heard mention of &lsquo;die carpett
hinaus an der fence&rsquo; and &lsquo;die fenshter und
die porch,&rsquo; and the exclamation, &lsquo;My goodness,
es was schlimm.&rsquo; I quilted faster than Katy
Groff, who showed me her hands, and said, &lsquo;You
have not been corn husking, as I have.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So we quilted and rolled, talked and laughed,
got one quilt done, and put in another. The work
was not fine; we laid it out by chalking around
a small plate. Aunt Sally&rsquo;s desire was rather to
get her quilting finished upon this great occasion
than for us to put in a quantity of fine needlework.
About five o&rsquo;clock we were called to supper. I
need not tell you all the particulars of this plentiful
meal; but the stewed chicken was tender and
we had coffee again.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg&nbsp;154]</a></span>
&ldquo;Polly M&rsquo;s husband now came over the creek
in the boat, to take her home, and he warned her
against the evening dampness. The rest of us
quilted a while by candles, and got the second
quilt done at about seven. At this quilting there
was little gossip, and less scandal. I displayed my
new alpaca and my dyed merino and the Philadelphia
bonnet which exposes the back of my
head to the wintry blast. Polly, for her part,
preferred a black silk sunbonnet; and so we parted,
with mutual invitations to visit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The proverbial neatness of the ancestors of the
Dutch colonists in America was characteristic of
their homes in the new land. This is well illustrated
in the following description of a Pennsylvania
Dutch farmer&rsquo;s home, similar to the one in
which the quilting above mentioned took place:
&ldquo;We keep one fire in winter. This is in the kitchen
which, with nice housekeepers, is the abode of
neatness, with its rag carpet and brightly polished
stove. Adjoining the kitchen is a state apartment,
also rag-carpeted, and called &lsquo;the room.&rsquo; Will
you go upstairs in a neat Dutch farmhouse? There
are rag carpets again. Gay quilts are on the best
beds, where green and red calico, perhaps in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg&nbsp;155]</a></span>
form of a basket, are displayed on a white ground;
or the beds bear brilliant coverlets of red, white, and
blue, as if to &lsquo;make the rash gazer wipe his eyes.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>There are many things to induce women to piece
quilts. The desire for a handsome bed furnishing,
or the wish to make a gift of one to a dear friend,
have inspired some women to make quilts. With
others, quilt making is a recreation, a diversion,
a means of occupying restless fingers. However,
the real inducement is love of the work; because
the desire to make a quilt exceeds all other desires.
In such a case it is worked on persistently, laid
aside reluctantly, and taken up each time with
renewed interest and pleasure. It is this intense
interest in the work which produces the most
beautiful quilts. On quilts that are made because
of the genuine interest in the work, the most painstaking
efforts are put forth; the passing of time is
not considered; and the belief of the majority of
such quilt makers, though unconfessed, doubtless,
is the equivalent of the old Arab proverb that
&ldquo;Slowness comes from God, but hurry from the
devil.&rdquo;</p>

<p>All women who are lonely do not live in isolated
farmhouses, prairie shacks, or remote villages. In
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg&nbsp;156]</a></span>
reality, there are more idle, listless hands in the
hearts of crowded bustling cities than in the quiet
country. City women, surrounded by many enticing
distractions, are turning more and more to
patchwork as a fascinating yet nerve-soothing
occupation. Not only is there a sort of companionship
between the maker and the quilt, but there
is also the great benefit derived from having found
a new interest in life, something worth while that
can be built up by one&rsquo;s own efforts.</p>

<p>An anecdote is told of a woman living in a quiet
little New England village who complained of her
loneliness there, where the quilting bees were the
only saving features of an otherwise colourless existence.
She told the interested listener that in
this out-of-the-way hamlet she did not mind the
monotony much because there were plenty of
&ldquo;quiltings,&rdquo; adding that she had helped that winter
at more than twenty-five quilting bees; besides
this, she had made a quilt for herself and also
helped on some of those of her immediate neighbours.</p>

<p>American women rarely think of quilts as being
made or used outside of their own country. In
reality quilts are made in almost every land on the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg&nbsp;157]</a></span>
face of the earth. Years ago, when the first New
England missionaries were sent to the Hawaiian
Islands, the native women were taught to piece
quilts, which they continue to do down to this day.
These Hawaiian women treasure their handiwork
greatly, and some very old and beautiful quilts
are to be found among these islands. In creating
their patchwork they have wandered from the
Puritanical designs of their teachers, and have
intermingled with the conventional figures the
gorgeous flowers that bloom beside their leaf-thatched,
vine-covered huts. To these women,
also, patchwork fills a place. It affords a means of
expression for individuality and originality in the
same way that it does for the lonely New England
women and for the isolated mountaineers of Kentucky.</p>

<p>Harriet Beecher Stowe, immortalized by &ldquo;Uncle
Tom&rsquo;s Cabin,&rdquo; produced other stories, not now so
familiar to us as to our countrymen of the Civil
War period, which showed an intimate knowledge
of the home life of the American people as well
as the vital questions of her day. In her novel
entitled the &ldquo;Minister&rsquo;s Wooing,&rdquo; which ran first
as a serial in the <i>Atlantic Monthly</i> in 1859, she
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg&nbsp;158]</a></span>
describes a quilting supposed to have been given
about the year 1800. Here we can view at close
range a real old-fashioned quilting, and gain some
insight into its various incidents of sociability and
gossip, typical of an early New England seafaring
village, as set forth in Mrs. Stowe&rsquo;s inimitable
style:</p>

<p>&ldquo;By two o&rsquo;clock a goodly company began to assemble.
Mrs. Deacon Twitchel arrived, soft,
pillowy, and plaintive as ever, accompanied by
Cerinthy Ann, a comely damsel, tall and trim,
with a bright black eye and a most vigorous and
determined style of movement. Good Mrs. Jones,
broad, expansive, and solid, having vegetated
tranquilly on in the cabbage garden of the virtues
since three years ago, when she graced our tea
party, was now as well preserved as ever, and
brought some fresh butter, a tin pail of cream, and a
loaf of cake made after a new Philadelphia receipt.
The tall, spare, angular figure of Mrs. Simeon
Brown alone was wanting; but she patronized Mrs.
Scudder no more, and tossed her head with a becoming
pride when her name was mentioned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The quilt pattern was gloriously drawn in oak
leaves, done in indigo; and soon all the company,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg&nbsp;159]</a></span>
young and old, were passing busy fingers over it,
and conversation went on briskly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Madame de Frontignac, we must not forget to
say, had entered with hearty abandon into the
spirit of the day. She had dressed the tall china
vases on the mantelpiece, and, departing from
the usual rule of an equal mixture of roses and
asparagus bushes, had constructed two quaint and
graceful bouquets where garden flowers were
mingled with drooping grasses and trailing wild
vines, forming a graceful combination which excited
the surprise of all who saw it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It&rsquo;s the very first time in my life that I ever
saw grass put into a flower pot,&rsquo; said Miss Prissy,
&lsquo;but I must say it looks as handsome as a picture.
Mary, I must say,&rsquo; she added, in an aside, &lsquo;I think
that Madame de Frontignac is the sweetest dressing
and appearing creature I ever saw; she don&rsquo;t
dress up nor put on airs, but she seems to see in a
minute how things ought to go; and if it&rsquo;s only a
bit of grass, or leaf, or wild vine, that she puts in her
hair, why, it seems to come just right. I should
like to make her a dress, for I know she would
understand my fit; do speak to her, Mary, in case
she should want a dress fitted here, to let me try it.&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg&nbsp;160]</a></span>
&ldquo;At the quilting Madame de Frontignac would
have her seat, and soon won the respect of the party
by the dexterity with which she used her needle;
though, when it was whispered that she learned
to quilt among the nuns, some of the elderly ladies
exhibited a slight uneasiness, as being rather
doubtful whether they might not be encouraging
papistical opinions by allowing her an equal share
in the work of getting up their minister&rsquo;s bed quilt;
but the younger part of the company was quite
captivated by her foreign air and the pretty manner
in which she lisped her English; and Cerinthy
Ann even went so far as to horrify her mother by
saying that she wished she&rsquo;d been educated in a
convent herself, a declaration which arose less
from native depravity than from a certain vigorous
disposition, which often shows itself in young
people, to shock the current opinions of their
elders and betters. Of course, the conversation
took a general turn, somewhat in unison with the
spirit of the occasion; and whenever it flagged,
some allusion to a forthcoming wedding, or some
sly hint at the future young Madame of the parish
was sufficient to awaken the dormant animation
of the company.</p>

<p class="incaption" style="padding-bottom: 3em;">It must be &ldquo;early to bed and early to rise&rdquo; for the child who would see the
sweet morning glory in all its loveliness, as it must be
found before all the dew is gone</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg&nbsp;161]</a></span>
&ldquo;Cerinthy Ann contrived to produce an agreeable
electric shock by declaring that for her part
she never could see into it how any girl could
marry a minister; that she should as soon think of
setting up housekeeping in a meeting-house.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, Cerinthy Ann!&rsquo; exclaimed her mother,
&lsquo;how can you go on so?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It&rsquo;s a fact,&rsquo; said the adventurous damsel;
&lsquo;now other men let you have some peace, but a
minister&rsquo;s always round under your feet.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;So you think the less you see of a husband, the
better?&rsquo; said one of the ladies.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Just my views!&rsquo; said Cerinthy, giving a decided
snip to her thread with her scissors. &lsquo;I like
the Nantucketers, that go off on four years&rsquo; voyages,
and leave their wives a clear field. If ever
I get married, I&rsquo;m going up to have one of those
fellows.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is to be remarked, in passing, that Miss
Cerinthy Ann was at this very time receiving surreptitious
visits from a consumptive-looking, conscientious
young theological candidate, who came
occasionally to preach in the vicinity, and put up
at the house of the deacon, her father. This good
young man, being violently attacked on the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg&nbsp;162]</a></span>
doctrine of election by Miss Cerinthy, had been drawn
on to illustrate it in a most practical manner, to
her comprehension; and it was the consciousness
of the weak and tottering state of the internal
garrison that added vigour to the young lady&rsquo;s
tones. As Mary had been the chosen confidante
of the progress of this affair, she was quietly amused
at the demonstration.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You&rsquo;d better take care, Cerinthy Ann,&rsquo; said her
mother, &lsquo;they say &ldquo;that those who sing before breakfast
will cry before supper.&rdquo; Girls talk about getting
married,&rsquo; she said, relapsing into a gentle
melancholy, &lsquo;without realizing its awful responsibilities.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, as to that,&rsquo; said Cerinthy, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve been practising
on my pudding now these six years, and I
shouldn&rsquo;t be afraid to throw one up chimney with
any girl.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This speech was founded on a tradition, current
in those times, that no young lady was fit to be
married till she could construct a boiled Indian
pudding of such consistency that it could be thrown
up a chimney and come down on the ground outside
without breaking; and the consequence of
Cerinthy Ann&rsquo;s sally was a general laugh.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg&nbsp;163]</a></span>
&ldquo;&lsquo;Girls ain&rsquo;t what they used to be in my day,&rsquo;
sententiously remarked an elderly lady. &lsquo;I remember
my mother told me when she was thirteen she
could knit a long cotton stocking in a day.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I haven&rsquo;t much faith in these stories of old
times, have you, girls?&rsquo; said Cerinthy, appealing to
the younger members at the frame.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;At any rate,&rsquo; said Mrs. Twitchel, &lsquo;our minister&rsquo;s
wife will be a pattern; I don&rsquo;t know anybody
that goes beyond her either in spinning or fine
stitching.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mary sat as placid and disengaged as the new
moon, and listened to the chatter of old and young
with the easy quietness of a young heart that has
early outlived life and looks on everything in the
world from some gentle, restful eminence far on
toward a better home. She smiled at everybody&rsquo;s
word, had a quick eye for everybody&rsquo;s wants, and
was ready with thimble, scissors, or thread, whenever
any one needed them; but once, when there
was a pause in the conversation, she and Mrs.
Marvyn were both discovered to have stolen away.
They were seated on the bed in Mary&rsquo;s little room,
with their arms around each other, communing in
low and gentle tones.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg&nbsp;164]</a></span>
&ldquo;&lsquo;Mary, my dear child,&rsquo; said her friend, &lsquo;this
event is very pleasant to me, because it places
you permanently near me. I did not know but
eventually this sweet face might lead to my losing
you who are in some respects the dearest friend
I have.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You might be sure,&rsquo; said Mary, &lsquo;I never would
have married, except that my mother&rsquo;s happiness
and the happiness of so good a friend seemed to depend
on it. When we renounce self in anything we
have reason to hope for God&rsquo;s blessing; and so I
feel assured of a peaceful life in the course I have
taken. You will always be as a mother to me,&rsquo;
she added, laying her head on her friend&rsquo;s shoulder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Mrs. Marvyn; &lsquo;and I must not let
myself think a moment how dear it might have been
to have you more my own. If you feel really,
truly happy, if you can enter on this life without
any misgivings&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I can,&rsquo; said Mary firmly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At this instant, very strangely, the string which
confined a wreath of seashells around her glass,
having been long undermined by moths, suddenly
broke and fell down, scattering the shells upon the
floor.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 308px;">

<p class="caption">&ldquo;KEEPSAKE QUILT&rdquo;</p>

<p class="incaption" style="padding-bottom: 3em;">The sunbonnet lassies suggest an outing or a call from playmates on the
morrow. These lassies may be dressed in bits of the gowns of the
little maid, and the quilt thus become a &ldquo;keepsake quilt&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg&nbsp;165]</a></span>
&ldquo;Both women started, for the string of shells had
been placed there by James; and though neither
was superstitious, this was one of those odd coincidences
that make hearts throb.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Dear boy!&rsquo; said Mary, gathering the shells up
tenderly; &lsquo;wherever he is, I shall never cease to
love him. It makes me feel sad to see this come
down; but it is only an accident; nothing of him
will ever fall out of my heart.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Marvyn clasped Mary closer to her, with
tears in her eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what, Mary, it must have been
the moths did that,&rsquo; said Miss Prissy, who had been
standing, unobserved, at the door for a moment
back; &lsquo;moths will eat away strings just so. Last
week Miss Vernon&rsquo;s great family picture fell down
because the moths eat through the cord; people
ought to use twine or cotton string always. But
I came to tell you that supper is all set, and the
doctor out of his study, and all the people are wondering
where you are.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mary and Mrs. Marvyn gave a hasty glance at
themselves in the glass, to be assured of their good
keeping, and went into the great kitchen, where a
long table stood exhibiting all that plentitude of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg&nbsp;166]</a></span>
provision which the immortal description of Washington
Irving has saved us the trouble of recapitulating
in detail.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The husbands, brothers, and lovers had come
in, and the scene was redolent of gayety. When
Mary made her appearance, there was a moment&rsquo;s
pause, till she was conducted to the side of the
doctor; when, raising his hand, he invoked a grace
upon the loaded board.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Unrestrained gayeties followed. Groups of
young men and maidens chatted together, and all
the gallantries of the times were enacted. Serious
matrons commented on the cake, and told each
other high and particular secrets in the culinary
art which they drew from remote family archives.
One might have learned in that instructive assembly
how best to keep moths out of blankets, how
to make fritters of Indian corn undistinguishable
from oysters, how to bring up babies by hand,
how to mend a cracked teapot, how to take out
grease from a brocade, how to reconcile absolute
decrees with free will, how to make five yards of
cloth answer the purpose of six, and how to put
down the Democratic party.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Prissy was in her glory; every bow of her
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg&nbsp;167]</a></span>
best cap was alive with excitement, and she presented
to the eyes of the astonished Newport gentry
an animated receipt book. Some of the information
she communicated, indeed, was so valuable
and important that she could not trust the
air with it, but whispered the most important portions
in a confidential tone. Among the crowd,
Cerinthy Ann&rsquo;s theological admirer was observed
in deeply reflective attitude; and that high-spirited
young lady added further to his convictions of the
total depravity of the species by vexing and discomposing
him in those thousand ways in which a
lively, ill-conditioned young woman will put to rout
a serious, well-disposed young man, comforting herself
with the reflection that by and by she would
repent of all her sins in a lump together.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Vain, transitory splendours! Even this evening,
so glorious, so heart cheering, so fruitful in
instruction and amusement, could not last forever.
Gradually the company broke up; the matrons
mounted soberly on horseback behind their
spouses, and Cerinthy consoled her clerical friend
by giving him an opportunity to read her a lecture
on the way home, if he found the courage to do so.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. and Mrs. Marvyn and Candace wound their
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg&nbsp;168]</a></span>
way soberly homeward; the doctor returned to his
study for nightly devotions; and before long sleep
settled down on the brown cottage.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what, Cato,&rsquo; said Candace, before
composing herself to sleep, &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t feel it in my
bones dat dis yer weddin&rsquo;s gwine to come off yit.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
